        "Bitmain Technologies Ltd., the world’s largest producer of crypto mining hardware, is preparing to launch its first U.S.-based manufacturing facility by the end of the third quarter of 2025. The company is reportedly considering locations in Texas and Florida, aiming to begin initial production in early 2026 with full-scale operations ramping up later that year. The new facility is expected to employ approximately 250 local workers across manufacturing, assembly, and maintenance functions. This move aligns with Bitmain’s broader effort to localize supply chains, reduce shipping delays, and mitigate the impact of rising tariffs and shifting geopolitical dynamics. Tariff Strategy and U.S. Industrial Push Drive Decision Bitmain’s entry into the U.S. manufacturing landscape comes amid heightened scrutiny of Chinese tech imports and a shifting regulatory stance toward domestic crypto infrastructure. By building locally, Bitmain seeks to bypass potential trade barriers while aligning with the “Made in America” industrial strategy championed under the current U.S. administration. The company aims to take advantage of more favorable conditions for crypto-related businesses in the U.S., including access to cheaper energy, stronger IP protections, and a large base of institutional clients. Bitmain joins rivals Canaan and MicroBT—who collectively dominate over 90% of the global crypto mining hardware market—in pivoting production to U.S. soil. These companies aim to protect their market access in North America and improve delivery times for major clients, including publicly listed mining operators such as Riot Platforms, CleanSpark, and Marathon Digital. According to industry insiders, the move could also serve to de-risk business operations amid increasingly complex U.S.-China relations. The trend reflects a broader decoupling in high-tech sectors, where companies are moving key parts of their production processes closer to end markets. Broader Implications for Crypto Infrastructure The U.S.-based facility will allow Bitmain to significantly reduce customs friction and provide faster, tariff-free access to North American clients. This is expected to enhance the operational efficiency of domestic mining firms, which have long relied on overseas shipping for their hardware needs. Despite increased labor and operating costs, the strategic value of a domestic footprint appears to outweigh these challenges. Industry analysts note that this manufacturing pivot may represent the early stages of a structural shift in the global crypto supply chain. As regulatory clarity in the U.S. continues to evolve, the presence of major Chinese hardware producers could help bridge operational gaps and further institutionalize mining operations within the country. Bitmain has not yet confirmed the final site location, but sources indicate that incentive packages, access to renewable energy sources, and proximity to key clients will play a key role in the decision. Texas, known for its crypto mining hubs and deregulated power grid, and Florida, which has shown increasing interest in fintech and blockchain innovation, are both strong contenders. The launch marks a significant milestone for Bitmain and signals growing confidence in the U.S. as a long-term crypto production hub. It also reflects a calculated response to a changing geopolitical landscape and the evolving demands of the global digital asset economy.",

        "The Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) officially submitted a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list the Canary Capital Staked INJ ETF, a proposed exchange-traded fund staking the native Injective Protocol (INJ) token. The ETF is designed to give traditional investors direct, regulated access to the Injective ecosystem through a yield-bearing, staking-enabled fund structure. Unlike conventional ETFs that simply track the price of a digital asset, the Staked INJ ETF would actively stake its holdings on an “approved staking platform,” generating rewards that boost overall returns for its shareholders. This means investors could benefit from both price appreciation and ongoing staking yields without handling tokens themselves or navigating the technical risks of direct staking. Canary Capital first proposed the ETF at the start of July before Cboe submitted its 19b-4 listing application—a required step for new ETF listings—to the SEC. The SEC must now formally acknowledge the filing, at which point a review process with key deadlines will begin; an initial response may come as early as September, but the process could extend until March 2026, given the agency’s statutory review timeline of up to 240 days. The regulatory path for staking-enabled crypto ETFs has become much more viable after a pivotal SEC clarification in May 2025. The SEC concluded that certain blockchain staking activities do not constitute securities offerings, removing a critical obstacle and providing long-awaited clarity for both fund issuers and the broader industry. Why INJ Injective Protocol stands out as a rapidly growing blockchain tailored for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, well known for its fast transaction speeds and robust interoperability. As interest in specialized blockchain ecosystems grows, a spot ETF backed by Injective gives U.S. investors regulated exposure to a rising star in the crypto space—while also capturing attractive staking yields. SEC’s Next Steps The SEC will review Cboe’s application and may establish an initial response deadline as early as September 2025. If acknowledged and ultimately approved, this ETF will join Solana and Ether as part of a new wave of staking-enabled, yield-generating ETFs accessible via conventional brokerage accounts.

        "Coinbase has included Bio Protocol and Euler in its asset roadmap, indicating they could be listed on the exchange down the line. In a July 29 X post, crypto exchange Coinbase announced that it has added Bio Protocol ( BIO ) and Euler (EUL) to its asset roadmap. Following the announcement, BIO rallied nearly 17% before giving up some of its gains and trading slightly lower at the time of writing. For the uninitiated, Bio Protocol is the native token powering a decentralized science (DeSci) ecosystem. It enables the creation of community-governed biotech research collectives, known as BioDAOs, and supports the tokenization of scientific intellectual property. Euler, on the other hand, is the governance token for Euler Finance , a permissionless DeFi lending protocol built on Ethereum. It allows users to lend and borrow a wide range of crypto assets, including long-tailed tokens not typically supported by other platforms. EUL has reacted more modestly, going up just 3.5% after the announcement. Both tokens have already secured listings on several popular cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Binance, OKX, Kraken, Gate.io, MEXC, KuCoin for Bio Protocol, and Kraken, KuCoin, HTX, Gate.io for Euler. However, investors should note that Coinbase’s asset roadmap only indicates the cryptocurrencies currently under consideration for potential listing and does not guarantee that they will ultimately be added to the platform. The Coinbase effect As a Tier-1 exchange, Coinbase listings often result in short-term rallies. Crypto traders refer to it as the “Coinbase effect.” The momentum stems from the platform’s reputation, broad user base, and appeal among institutional investors. Market participants tend to interpret listings as a signal of legitimacy, which frequently leads to increased demand and upward price pressure in the short term. Historically, several tokens have recorded double-digit intraday gains following a Coinbase announcement or listing. However, while initial rallies are common, they are not guaranteed, nor do they always sustain over the long term. Market conditions, token supply dynamics, and broader investor sentiment all play a role in determining whether the listing leads to lasting appreciation. For instance, NEWT, the native token of Newton Protocol, crashed 44% shortly after its listing on Coinbase. According to a report by crypto.news, the sharp drop was driven by investors selling off their airdropped tokens to secure profits, leading to heightened selling pressure immediately following the listing. Another example that underscores this volatility is the case of Venice AI’s token, VVV. Shortly after being listed on Coinbase, the token saw a sharp initial pump. However, the rally was short-lived, and the price crashed after reports emerged that the project team allegedly issued and sold approximately $5.7 million worth of VVV tokens around the time of the listing. Since both BIO and EUL are already listed on several major exchanges, the impact of a potential Coinbase listing may not be as pronounced as it would be for a newly launched token.",

        "BitMine , the largest corporate holder of Ethereum (ETH) , believes the asset’s fair value could be as high as $60,000, far above its current market price of around $3,800. In a July 28 post on X, BitMine also noted that some long-term models place ETH’s potential value at more than $700,000. [Editor’s Note: At $700,000, Ethereum’s market cap would be $84 trillion. By comparison, if Bitcoin reaches $1 million, its market cap would be $21 trillion. Gold’s market cap is currently around $15 trillion.] Why ETH’s price would surge The company revealed that this estimate was derived after consulting multiple research firms to assess Ethereum’s “replacement value,” the theoretical cost of rebuilding or replacing the utility ETH provides. BitMine claims this value reflects growing institutional recognition of Ethereum as a major macro asset for the coming decade. The company further argued that the rapid expansion of stablecoins could mark a turning point for Ethereum’s adoption, likening their rise to the breakthrough moment ChatGPT created for artificial intelligence. BitMine also cited US Commerce Secretary Scott Bessent’s projection that the stablecoin market could exceed $4 trillion, over ten times its current size, as a strong signal of Ethereum’s long-term potential. With more than 60% of stablecoins issued on Ethereum and Wall Street increasingly exploring tokenized assets, the network is positioning itself as the backbone of future digital finance. BitMine’s Ethereum plan Considering this, BitMine stated that it is not just buying ETH but also building an ecosystem around the digital asset. According to the firm, it intends to become to Ethereum what Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) is to Bitcoin by acquiring 5% of its circulating supply . BitMine pointed out that it is well on the way to achieving that milestone as its ETH exposure reached $2.7 billion within 18 days, which is well ahead of the time it took MicroStrategy to reach that level of Bitcoin exposure. Meanwhile, the company also framed its Ethereum treasury strategy as a form of infrastructure rather than merely holding a financial asset. According to BitMine, staking ETH secures the network, generates yield, and aligns firms with Ethereum’s long-term success. Additionally, as Wall Street moves closer to on-chain finance, BitMine sees ETH not just as a speculative play but as a foundational layer for future institutional systems. To achieve its goal, the firm plans to develop a US-based validator network, contribute to Ethereum governance, and invest in on-chain projects that strengthen the network. The company’s Ethereum accumulation has already made waves in traditional markets. According to Google Finance data, BitMine’s stock (BMNR) surged from $4.26 in June to a peak of $107.48 on July 7. It now trades around $35.11. Its net asset value per share also spiked from $4 on July 8 to $23 by July 27, a sixfold jump in under three weeks.

        "Except for its name, nothing is little about Little Pepe ($LILPEPE). Not its ambition, token giveaway, nor the amount raised. The project itself wants to take meme coins to the next level with its Little Pepe Layer 2 blockchain. Once launched, this will deliver the speed, security, and low fees that modern meme coins need. With the L2, common issues with popular blockchains like Ethereum and Solana will be addressed once and for all. But this journey needs support, which is where the Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) token presale comes in. What’s the Little Pepe Presale All About? It’s a fundraising effort that will allow you to take a direct hand at making the L2 happen. Costing only $0.0017 each, it’s a very affordable way to invest in the project. To date, Little Pepe has raised over $13.7M, making it one of the year’s best crypto to watch. If you spend at least $100 in the presale and complete tasks, you’ll get the chance to join the project’s $777K giveaway. This prize pool will be divided equally between 10 winners, which means you’ll receive $77K worth of $LILPEPE tokens. To get started, head on to the Little Pepe presale page, connect your crypto wallet, enter how many tokens you want to buy, and pay with your credit/debit card, $ETH, or $USDT. From the Earth to the Moon: The Little Pepe Roadmap Like every token presale, Little Pepe’s goal is to go to the moon. To get there, it has a three-phase roadmap, with the presale happening at stage 1. Right now, the team is also building partnerships and creating buzz to make the project even more viral. When it’s moon-ready, the token will be launched in the market’s top exchanges and on Uniswap. This will add further hype to the project as investors buy and trade $LILPEPE. Finally comes the blockchain launch. With an ambitious goal of hitting the top 100 in CoinMarketCap, Little Pepe is taking the right steps to get there. This is where its tokenomics comes in. Tale of the Tape: Little Pepe in Numbers Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) has a total supply of 100B tokens. A huge chunk of this will go towards Chain Reserves (30%) and the Presale (26.5%), which ensure the project’s stability well after the chain is launched. Another thing to note is its Marketing budget (10%). As meme coins rely heavily on hype, this token allocation will allow Little Pepe to get the buzz it needs to succeed, particularly in the early stages of the presale. When it comes to marketing, the team plans on collaborating with influencers, spreading memes and videos, and potentially putting up a billboard to get the word out both online and offline. Slowly But Surely: The Little Pepe Vesting Schedule Little Pepe will also have a token vesting schedule, which will be as follows: TGE – 0% of tokens will be unlocked at launch Cliff – Tokens will be locked for a further three months Vesting – 5% of $LILPEPE tokens will be released every 30 days after the cliff This means that not all tokens will be released post-presale, but rather gradually over time. The strategy is important for several reasons. For one, this helps prevent sell-offs that can crash the token’s price. It also signals that the team is here for the long term and not for short-term gains. Finally, this allows everyone—from the developers to investors—to grow with the project. Time to Hop In—The Little Pepe Hype Train is Here With its goal to dominate the meme coin marketplace, Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is making bold moves to make it happen. It’s no surprise that it’s already raised over $13.7M in its presale, with plenty of room for growth as it progresses. If you’re ready to join the Little Pepe hype train, then head on to its official presale page and grab some coins.",

        "Binance has launched a new product, the Discount Buy, which allows users to buy crypto at prices lower than the current market price and earn APR rewards. How does it work? According to the recent notice on the platform’s page, Discount Buy is a product that supports yield and provides users the opportunity to purchase major tokens like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) as well as other assets at lower prices compared to the current market ones. It implements a system that enables users to use “target buy” in order to purchase crypto below the current market prices. After subscribing to Discount Buy, users can either accumulate crypto at the chosen target buy price they have set prior to the purchase or they can instead earn yield in return. Basically, what this means is either users can buy crypto at “discounted prices” using target buy. If the targeted price doesn’t occur, then users can get the equivalent of “cash-back rewards” by earning some passive yield on tokens they wanted to buy at lower prices. How Binance users can make use of Discount Buy Users who subscribe to Discount Buy have two options: either purchase crypto at a discounted rate in the future or earn fixed annualized rewards if market prices rise. The product appeals to those looking for a strategic entry into the market without committing to current prices. Before subscribing to Discount Buy, users must first select one of three key parameters: Target Buy Price, Settlement Price, Knockout Price, and the Settlement Date. The Target Buy Price is typically lower than the current market price, while the Knockout Price is the price at which the user will no longer choose to buy the crypto asset they had their sights on. The Settlement Price is the average price during a 30-minute window on the Settlement Date, which determines the final outcome. What happens on the Binance settlement date? By the time the deadline of your Binance Discount Buy rolls around, there are a few outcomes that could occur. Based on the Settlement Price, your funds will either buy crypto, earn rewards, or a mix of both. If the settlement price set by the user is less than or equal to the target buy price, then the user will be able to use up 100% of their investment into buying crypto at the set target buy price. If it’s between the Target and Knockout Price, half the user’s funds will be used to buy the crypto asset. Meanwhile, the other half is returned in stablecoins . If it’s at or above the Knockout Price, the user does not purchase the crypto. Instead they will receive their investment back in full alongside additional APR rewards.",

        "Investment Giant Ark Invest Prepares to Launch Staking Services for This Altcoin! Partnership Process Has Begun! Details Here ARK Invest has taken another significant step in the crypto market, forming a strategic partnership with SOL Strategies for staking services. Cathie Wood-led investment firm ARK Invest has taken another significant step into the crypto market, forming a strategic partnership with Canadian-based SOL Strategies for staking services. This partnership reflects the growing appetite among institutions for yield-generating crypto assets. ARK Invest Forms Staking Partnership with SOL Strategies: Institutional Demand Continues to Rise ARK Invest will now migrate its validator operations onto SOL Strategies' staking infrastructure as part of the company's Digital Assets Revolutions Fund. Founded in 2020, the fund aims to generate returns over a 4–5-year market cycle by investing in 10 to 12 cryptocurrencies. SOL Strategies CEO Leah Wald told Cointelegraph: “We serve corporate and institutional-level clients seeking regulated and reliable access to Solana through delegated staking and customized validator infrastructure.” Another key player in the partnership is institutional custody platform BitGo. Having partnered with SOL Strategies in April, BitGo will also be part of this new model. What is Staking and Why is it Important? Staking is the process of securing a blockchain network by locking cryptocurrencies for a specific period of time and earning rewards in return. On the Solana network, staking periods (epochs) last approximately two to three days, at the end of which stakers receive rewards in SOL. According to Wald, the staking operations the company currently manages include: 5 active validators are working, 3.59 million SOL (approximately $647.2 million) worth of assets are being staked, More than 5,700 different wallets are actively staking. Only 12% of staked assets come from the company treasury, while the rest is held by third parties. While staking offers the potential for high returns, it can be risky due to validator behavior. Validators who violate network rules may be penalized through “slashing” of their staked tokens. According to Solana Compass data, there are currently 403 million SOL tokens staked, worth approximately $73.5 billion. *This is not investment advice.",

        "Crypto exchange Bitget is adding GAIA to its launchpool lineup, putting millions of tokens on the table in rewards. According to a July 29 press release , spot trading for GAIA ( SN57 )/USDT will kick off on July 30 at 09:00 UTC. The GAIA launchpool campaign will let eligible users lock BGB from July 30 to August 1 for a shot at earning from a pool of 3,858,300 GAIA. Lock limits range from 5 to 50,000 BGB, with caps based on VIP tier. Alongside the listing, Bitget is running a CandyBomb campaign offering 633,000 GAIA in rewards. This includes 211,000 GAIA split across GAIA, BTC, and BGB trading pools for new users, and 422,000 GAIA reserved for GAIA trades by existing users. Bitget is also launching an official X giveaway. Between July 30 and August 1, up to 750 qualified users can win a share of 125,000 GAIA by engaging in activities like following both Bitget and Gaia, quoting the giveaway post with #GAIAxBitgetLaunchpool, tagging a friend, trading GAIA, and completing an attached form. Other campaigns include a community challenge on Bitget Discord with another 125,000 GAIA on the table. This will require users to trade or deposit and complete simple tasks like signing up, tagging a friend, or joining Bitget’s official groups. What is GAIA? GAIA is the native token of a decentralized AI network designed to let users create, host, and monetize autonomous AI agents. The token powers transactions across the platform, including model deployment, data access, and AI service execution. Built on blockchain technology, the GAIA network enables users to run advanced models like Qwen2 0.5B Instruct and customize them using personal or business data. By decentralizing compute and storage, GAIA aims to offer an alternative to centralized AI platforms, where control, data ownership, and monetization are often limited. The protocol is also building a decentralized weather forecasting system, aiming to deliver high-resolution, 10-day global forecasts across key climate variables. It runs on Bittensor’s Subnet 57 and uses advanced AI models like Graphcast and Pangu. GAIA plays a central role in maintaining the ecosystem’s economic incentives. Participants can earn GAIA for running nodes, sharing models, or offering AI services, while users spend GAIA to interact with deployed agents. Bitget said the GAIA listing is part of its push into decentralized AI, aiming to expand its ecosystem with projects focused on data ownership and AI-powered Web3 tools. Despite the listing buzz, on-chain activity around GAIA remains muted. GAIA price trend According to crypto.news data , GAIA trades at $2.04 at the time of writing. Over the past 24 hours, the token is down approximately 6.6%, extending its month-long slump to 16.4%. Trading volume in the past 24 hours sits just under a modest $97,000. GAIA was deployed earlier this year and initially gained traction on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap. But after peaking around $4.12 in mid-June, the token has drifted lower, likely weighed down by thinning volume and profit-taking. Beyond Bitget, other major exchanges like Binance , KuCoin , and Kraken are also gearing up to list GAIA, stirring hopes for fresh momentum for the project.",

But while XLM news points to a potential rally toward $1.50, a lesser-known crypto named Remittix (RTX) is quietly gaining momentum, and some believe it could outshine Stellar altogether in the coming months.XLM Price Builds Momentum, But Caution LingersXLM is currently trading around $0.429, marking its highest monthly close since 2022. Brandt’s technical analysis spotlighted a multi-year inverse head and shoulders pattern, with a breakout zone just above the $0.50 mark. A sustained close above that level could send XLM price surging as high as $1.50.However, that bullish case depends on consistent buying pressure and a clean close above $0.45.

        "Crypto funds have just recorded a fifteenth consecutive week of inflows, confirming an upward trend despite market volatility. Ether stands out clearly, attracting the majority of capital on its own. Bitcoin, on the other hand, shows a slight decline, making way for the rise of altcoins. Crypto capital floods in despite the storm It has now been 15 consecutive weeks that crypto funds have recorded net inflows. Despite palpable volatility and downward pressure on major assets, $1.9 billion was injected into crypto investment products last week. Bitcoin, although an undisputed pioneer, saw its ETPs experience a slight unwinding with $175 million in outflows. A weak signal, certainly, but significant. Investors seem to have eased off, not out of disinterest, but to reposition their stakes elsewhere. Indeed, they are notably turning towards assets in regulatory excitement, like Ether . Meanwhile, the global AUM of crypto products has crossed a symbolic threshold , reaching $221.4 billion. The year 2025 has already seen $29.5 billion in inflows, shattering previous records. The numbers are clear: cryptocurrencies, even when shaken, continue to captivate institutional markets. Ether steals the spotlight: between record inflows and regulatory hopes With $1.59 billion in new funds injected in one week, Ether ETPs posted their second-largest weekly inflow ever. A figure that turns heads, especially since it arrives amid a slight decline in ETH price. For James Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares, this massive move is not a flash in the pan but rather a maneuver linked to anticipation of Ether-based ETFs. And Ether is not alone in this surge. Solana and XRP, with respective inflows of $311.5 million and $189.6 million, fit into this pre-positioning strategy. Investors are clearly betting on the next wave of U.S. regulation, which could open the floodgates for ETFs on other major cryptos. At the opposite end, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash endure modest withdrawals. These outflows, although limited, suggest increased selectivity among investors. Capital seeks liquidity but also credibility. And in this quest, Ether, supported by its robust ecosystem and ETF prospects, takes the lead. A momentum that slows but settles in Despite this 15th week of inflows, the mechanism is starting to falter. This week’s $1.9 billion represents a 57% drop from the previously recorded $4.4 billion. A slowdown? More like a breather, according to the data. Giants like BlackRock, with its iShares crypto ETF, led inflows ($1.56 billion), though this figure is plummeting compared to the previous week. Among other players, Fidelity continues its outflows ($123 million), while ARK Invest tempers its capital flight. Only 21Shares, based in Europe, maintains course with modest but stable growth. As for Grayscale, the figures are paradoxical: $356 million in recent inflows, but a year still marked by $1.3 billion in cumulative outflows. This contrast illustrates the turmoil institutional investors face in their quest for crypto exposure. BlackRock, by contrast, dominates undisputedly with $25.8 billion in inflows in 2025, capturing alone 87.5% of the total flows into crypto ETPs . A hegemonic position that leaves little doubt: traditional finance has firmly taken its place in the digital asset universe.",

        "Crypto investors are getting more selective in 2025. With the market full of noise, analysts say the best crypto to buy now comes down to one question: utility. Two names are standing out: Remittix (RTX) and Snorter Bot (SNORT). Both offer real use cases, but one of them is already showing signs of breaking out.Snorter Bot Gains Steam With Telegram IntegrationSnorter Bot is an on-chain trading app built for the Solana network. It helps users track, snipe, and manage Solana tokens directly from Telegram. That makes it popular among active traders who want to catch fast-moving tokens before they pump.The platform’s token, $SNORT, powers the entire system. It’s used for governance, staking, and rewards, meaning the more people use the bot, the more demand builds for the token. This closed-loop setup has driven early growth, especially with Solana trading volume hitting new highs this summer.Still, SNORT is mostly focused on one chain and one use: traders looking for speed. For those seeking the best crypto to buy now with real-world payment impact, analysts are pointing to Remittix.Remittix Offers Real Utility and 450% Growth PotentialWhile Snorter Bot targets speed and sniping, Remittix is going after a much larger opportunity, which is global payments. The Ethereum-based project is solving a $19 trillion problem by allowing users to send crypto directly to bank accounts in 30+ countries.Remittix recently surged past $17.4 million raised and over 570 million tokens sold, with its price currently at $0.0876, with demand still climbing ahead of its September 15 wallet beta launch. This beta will have full crypto wallet features and is already pulling attention from both freelancers and investors.Remittix Is Quietly Becoming the Breakout Crypto of 2025$0.0876 price with over $17.4 million already raisedThe 50% token bonus is still active for early adoptersQ3 wallet beta launching September 15 with full functionalityTrusted by real users like a Mexico-based digital agency now paying 3 freelancers weekly via RTXWith its rapid traction and growing ecosystem, strategists say Remittix is the best crypto to buy now for those looking beyond trading hype and into actual use cases.Snorter Bot is exciting for Solana traders and fast snipers.

        "Zug, Switzerland, July 29th, 2025, ChainwireIka, the pioneering blockchain infrastructure provider, has officially launched its mainnet, marking a significant milestone in blockchain interoperability. The launch introduces the first-ever zero-trust multiparty computation (MPC) network capable of native cross-chain asset control directly from smart contracts on the Sui blockchain.Ika’s protocol allows Sui-based smart contracts to securely and seamlessly manage native assets across many blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and modern L1s and L2s, without relying on bridges, token wrapping, or trusted third parties. This breakthrough eliminates common risks associated with cross-chain solutions, such as vulnerabilities inherent in bridging protocols or wrapped tokens, fundamentally transforming blockchain interoperability.At the heart of Ika’s innovation is the introduction of dWallets, a decentralized, programmable, and transferable signing mechanism. dWallets enable both the user and the Ika network to collaboratively sign transactions, while enforcing logic governed by smart contracts. This empowers developers and institutions to build and operate securely across various blockchains with native asset control.The technological core of Ika is its novel 2PC-MPC cryptography protocol, previously thought impractical for decentralized environments due to latency, scalability, and security constraints. Ika has overcome these hurdles, delivering sub-second latency and linear scalability, without compromising on decentralization, delivering a network that can be supported by hundreds of operators globally. Each operation includes cryptographic safeguards that require explicit user participation, supporting a zero-trust security framework.The network’s native token, IKA, plays a critical role by securing the infrastructure through a decentralized, permissionless proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. IKA tokens are integral for transaction fees, spam prevention, rewarding reliable operators, and network governance.Several leading blockchain projects on Sui are already utilizing Ika’s mainnet, demonstrating the protocol’s versatility and robustness:Native is enhancing Bitcoin liquidity through native lending and DeFi services.Human Tech delivers “Wallet-as-a-Protocol” solutions, seamlessly managing cross-chain assets.Rhei Finance offers institutional-grade zero-trust multi-chain DeFi services.Aeon advances decentralized custody solutions optimized for AI-driven financial management.Nativerse pioneers Bitcoin-backed stablecoins without synthetic or wrapped intermediaries.Ekko integrates AI chatbots with decentralized security via MPC technology.Legacy Link facilitates secure digital asset inheritance through streamlined estate management.Full Sail introduces an advanced Automated Market Maker (AMM) leveraging Ika’s interoperability.“Today marks the start of a new era in blockchain interoperability,” said Ika Co-Founder Omer Sadika. “Our mainnet launch is not just a technological milestone, but a paradigm shift, bringing native Zero-Trust interoperability to Sui , and unlocking unprecedented possibilities for developers, institutions, and individual users alike.”With Ika now live, blockchain projects, financial institutions, and developers can deploy multi-chain applications on Sui, operate as network participants, or engage with the Ika network.For further information, users can visit https://ika.xyz or follow Ika on X.About IkaIka is the fastest parallel MPC network, offering sub-second latency, unprecedented scale and decentralization, and zero-trust security.

Stay informed on market trends with COINOTAG’s latest analysis. What caused the $120 billion crypto market decline? The total crypto market cap dropped sharply from $3.92 trillion to $3.80 trillion within 24 hours due to widespread sell-offs in high-risk tokens. Memecoins such as Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe were the hardest hit, reflecting investor caution amid regulatory delays in the U.S. and concerns over exchange stability in India. How did memecoins perform during the market dip? Memecoins faced significant losses: Dogecoin fell 7.99%, Shiba Inu dropped 6.30%, and Pepe declined 9.06%. Other tokens like Bonk and Floki also saw declines exceeding 9%, while smaller cap coins such as Fartcoin plummeted over 17%. This volatility highlights the risk profile of meme assets compared to more established cryptocurrencies. Source: TradingView Why did Bitcoin remain stable amid the sell-off? Bitcoin held steady near $119,000, showing resilience despite the broader market downturn. Its daily RSI at 60.9 and stable On-Balance Volume (OBV) indicate neutral momentum and consolidation rather than active selling. This stability suggests that Bitcoin was not the primary cause of the recent volatility, with traders focusing on riskier meme tokens instead. What external factors influenced the market sentiment? Regulatory uncertainty played a key role. The U.S. SEC delayed decisions on the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF and Grayscale’s Solana Trust conversion, extending market ambiguity. Meanwhile, in India, Coinbase’s potential acquisition of CoinDCX followed a significant valuation drop and a $44 million hack, amplifying caution among investors and contributing to sell-side pressure.

The decline was primarily caused by sharp sell-offs in memecoins due to regulatory delays in the U.S. SEC decisions and concerns over exchange stability in India, leading to cautious investor sentiment. Why did Bitcoin remain stable despite the market sell-off? Bitcoin’s stability near $119,000 was due to its established market position and neutral momentum indicators, making it less susceptible to the volatility affecting riskier meme tokens. { "@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "HowTo", "name": "How to Understand the Recent Crypto Market Decline", "step": [{ "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Monitor key memecoin price movements like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE for early signs of market shifts." },{ "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Track regulatory developments from authorities such as the U.S. SEC to gauge market sentiment." },{ "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Analyze Bitcoin’s price stability and momentum indicators to assess overall market health." }]} Key Takeaways Market Cap Decline : The crypto market lost $120 billion within 24 hours, dropping from $3.92 trillion to $3.80 trillion. Memecoin Volatility : Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe led losses, reflecting heightened risk in meme assets. Regulatory Impact : Delays in U.S. SEC decisions and Indian exchange issues increased market uncertainty. Conclusion The recent $120 billion crypto market decline underscores the vulnerability of memecoins amid regulatory and exchange uncertainties. Bitcoin’s relative stability highlights its role as a market anchor during turbulent periods. Investors should monitor regulatory updates and token volatility closely to navigate ongoing market fluctuations effectively. { "@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "BreadcrumbList", "itemListElement": [{ "@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://en.coinotag.com" },{ "@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Crypto News", "item": "https://en.coinotag.com/crypto-news" },{ "@type": "ListItem", "position": 3, "name": "Crypto Market Suffers $120 Billion Drop as Memecoins Plunge Amid Regulatory Uncertainty" }]}',

        "After a recent retracement from its high in July, Dogecoin (DOGE) is starting to pick up again as crypto analysts predict a bullish shift to $0.50 as a short-term target. But while DOGE speculators are utterly focused on the meme token, which is fueled by perhaps another hype, serious traders and investors are positioning in something better – Remittix (RTX). Let’s talk DOGE first before we explore what Remittix is all about and why it’s a fundamentally stronger project that could do a 10x or more move by year-end. Can DOGE Actually Break $0.50 This Summer?Dogecoin has been on a tear this cycle, with renewed mainstream mentions and listings among top retail platforms, and many are now eyeing $0.50 as a possible milestone by August. Traders point to bullish patterns in Dogecoin’s price on the weekly chart and increasing sentiment on crypto forums and social channels.If Bitcoin breaks out of the current range to the upside and capital rotates into meme coins, DOGE could spike. Still, technical resistance between $0.45 and $0.50 will be challenging if retail enthusiasm fades or meme hype loses steam.Why Remittix (RTX) Could Be the Better Play NowWhile DOGE rides the meme wave, investors looking for outsized gains are turning to Remittix (RTX), a project built for practical impact, not just social media chatter.Real-world remittance model: Remittix addresses a massive global need: low-cost, near-instant cross-border payments, which the legacy systems have failed to address. Growth-driven tokenomics: Since real-use cases back RTX, its price is expected to be sustainable, thereby driving long-term investor confidence. What’s more, there’s an ongoing $250,000 crypto giveaway. Token success and surging adoption: Remittix has raised over $17.5 million, and adoption continues to widen with new partnership rollouts and a polished user interface. Whales are quietly building positions, and smarter capital is betting on long-term upside, not short-lived hype.Better risk-to-reward profile: DOGE might return 2× from $0.25, but speculative sentiment can fade fast. In contrast, RTX offers potential 10× 50× gains, especially for early stakeholders riding behind tangible product development.Also, Dogecoin wins when it comes to brand recognition and cultural relevance. Elon Musk’s tweets can still send it soaring, and the community is as passionate as ever. But for investors looking for solid fundamentals and actual use cases, Remittix offers far more upside, particularly in a market cycle that’s starting to reward utility over memes. So, if you’re chasing short-term meme gains, Dogecoin price might still move toward $0.50 this summer, with volatility and quick exits in mind. But if you’re looking for longer-term growth paired with real utility, Remittix makes a strong case.Discover the future of PayFi with Remittix by checking out the project here:Website: https://remittix.io/ Socials: https://linktr.ee/remittix $250,000 Giveaway: https://gleam.io/competitions/nz84L-250000-remittix-giveaway",

      content:
        'Zug, Switzerland, July 29th, 2025, ChainwireIka, the pioneering blockchain infrastructure provider, has officially launched its mainnet, marking a significant milestone in blockchain interoperability. The launch introduces the first-ever zero-trust multiparty computation (MPC) network capable of native cross-chain asset control directly from smart contracts on the Sui blockchain.Ika’s protocol allows Sui-based smart contracts to securely and seamlessly manage native assets across many blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and modern L1s and L2s, without relying on bridges, token wrapping, or trusted third parties. This breakthrough eliminates common risks associated with cross-chain solutions, such as vulnerabilities inherent in bridging protocols or wrapped tokens, fundamentally transforming blockchain interoperability.At the heart of Ika’s innovation is the introduction of dWallets, a decentralized, programmable, and transferable signing mechanism. dWallets enable both the user and the Ika network to collaboratively sign transactions, while enforcing logic governed by smart contracts. This empowers developers and institutions to build and operate securely across various blockchains with native asset control.The technological core of Ika is its novel 2PC-MPC cryptography protocol, previously thought impractical for decentralized environments due to latency, scalability, and security constraints. Ika has overcome these hurdles, delivering sub-second latency and linear scalability, without compromising on decentralization, delivering a network that can be supported by hundreds of operators globally. Each operation includes cryptographic safeguards that require explicit user participation, supporting a zero-trust security framework.The network’s native token, IKA, plays a critical role by securing the infrastructure through a decentralized, permissionless proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. IKA tokens are integral for transaction fees, spam prevention, rewarding reliable operators, and network governance.Several leading blockchain projects on Sui are already utilizing Ika’s mainnet, demonstrating the protocol’s versatility and robustness:Native is enhancing Bitcoin liquidity through native lending and DeFi services.Human Tech delivers "Wallet-as-a-Protocol" solutions, seamlessly managing cross-chain assets.Rhei Finance offers institutional-grade zero-trust multi-chain DeFi services.Aeon advances decentralized custody solutions optimized for AI-driven financial management.Nativerse pioneers Bitcoin-backed stablecoins without synthetic or wrapped intermediaries.Ekko integrates AI chatbots with decentralized security via MPC technology.Legacy Link facilitates secure digital asset inheritance through streamlined estate management.Full Sail introduces an advanced Automated Market Maker (AMM) leveraging Ika’s interoperability."Today marks the start of a new era in blockchain interoperability," said Ika Co-Founder Omer Sadika. "Our mainnet launch is not just a technological milestone, but a paradigm shift, bringing native Zero-Trust interoperability to Sui , and unlocking unprecedented possibilities for developers, institutions, and individual users alike."With Ika now live, blockchain projects, financial institutions, and developers can deploy multi-chain applications on Sui, operate as network participants, or engage with the Ika network.For further information, users can visit https://ika.xyz or follow Ika on X.About IkaIka is the fastest parallel MPC network, offering sub-second latency, unprecedented scale and decentralization, and zero-trust security. As the premier choice for interoperability, decentralized custody, and chain abstraction, Ika is set to revolutionize digital asset security and multi-chain DeFi.

        "详细分析 在加密货币交易的动态世界中,鲸鱼活动往往预示着重大市场变动,一位著名的Solana投资者最近的举动吸引了广泛关注。根据链上分析专家@lookonchain的报告,鲸鱼24BLFj在2025年7月29日报告前约9小时,以1.22美元的价格出售了300万$Fartcoin代币,价值365万美元。这一交易突显了大户在波动性模因币市场中的获利策略,可能影响短期价格动态和交易者情绪。 鲸鱼的积累和获利实现策略 深入分析这位鲸鱼的交易历史,他在2月26日至3月21日期间以平均0.26美元的价格积累了889万$Fartcoin代币,总投资231万美元。这种在低价阶段的战略性进入强调了加密投资中时机的重要性,早期的积累可能带来指数级回报。在最近的出售后,该鲸鱼仍持有189万$Fartcoin代币,目前价值216万美元,贡献了807万美元的总利润,涨幅达349%。这些链上数据可通过solscan.io验证,为交易者提供了关于积累模式和退出策略的具体洞察,可能预示Solana模因币生态的更广泛趋势。 市场影响和交易机会 从交易角度来看,这次在1.22美元的部分清算可能对$Fartcoin引入卖压,如果后续出售发生,可能测试1.00至1.10美元的关键支撑位。监控Solana代币的交易者应注意交易量的增加,因为鲸鱼活动往往与波动性加剧相关。例如,如果链上指标显示交易计数或流动性变化上升,这可能为逢低买入者提供机会。在缺乏实时价格数据的情况下,更广泛的市场情绪倾向于对模因币的谨慎,机构资金可能转向BTC或ETH等更成熟资产。然而,349%的获利实现展示了利基代币的高回报潜力,鼓励散户交易者使用止损订单等风险管理工具,在进入价位下方10-15%设置以缓解下行风险。 分析跨市场相关性,$Fartcoin的表现与Solana生态的兴趣激增相关,模因币推动了显著的链上活动。交易者可能探索FART/SOL或FART/USDT等交易对,关注24小时成交量峰值以指示动量转变。历史模式表明,鲸鱼抛售后价格可能盘整后反弹,提供摆动交易机会,如果看涨催化剂出现,目标可设在前高1.50美元附近。此外,整合RSI(如果接近70则可能超买)和移动平均线等技术指标可帮助识别1.30美元的阻力位,提供数据驱动的进出信号。对于长期持有者,此事件强调了多元化的价值,或许将投资组合的5-10%分配到高波动资产,同时监控鲸鱼钱包的未来动向。 更广泛的加密市场情绪和风险评估 在整体加密货币市场的背景下,像$Fartcoin这样的代币鲸鱼获利反映了成熟的情绪,早投资者在潜在监管逆风或宏观因素中锁定收益。没有当前市场数据,必须考虑与主要指数的相关性;例如,如果BTC跌破60,000美元,模因币往往放大下行,提供通过反向对冲的机会。交易者应优先使用链上验证工具跟踪类似鲸鱼行为,因为这些可预先价格波动。最终,这个$Fartcoin交易案例展示了加密中的机会与风险结合,通过对积累成本、出售价格和持有模式的明智分析,可以指导盈利策略,始终强调验证数据而非投机。",

        "El precio de PancakeSwap (CAKE) subió un 13% en 24 horas, impulsado por la actividad en BNB Chain y el mercado de altcoins en general. El alza se vio favorecida por un aumento del 200% en el volumen de operaciones en medio del lanzamiento de Infinity y la nueva campaña de incentivos Si CAKE rompe la resistencia de USD 3.30, los alcistas podrían apuntar a USD 10. PancakeSwap busca extender las ganancias por encima de un nivel clave, con ganancias en las últimas 24 horas en medio de un aumento del 200% en el volumen de operaciones. PancakeSwap Infinity del exchange descentralizado ha provocado un frenesí de actividad. A medida que Bitcoin rebotó y el precio de BNB se disparó, CAKE ha atraído a comerciantes y entusiastas que buscan una oportunidad a medida que la plataforma se expande. El precio de PancakeSwap gana dos dígitos CAKE subió un 13% en 24 horas, impulsado por la actividad en BNB Chain y el mercado de altcoins en general, ya que el precio de BNB superó los USD 850. El catalizador del último movimiento de precios parece ser la reciente presentación de PancakeSwap Infinity en la red Base. Infinity es el marco modular de la plataforma de finanzas descentralizadas, con “Hooks” personalizables que ofrecen complementos de contratos inteligentes. Los desarrolladores y usuarios pueden aprovechar la innovación para fondos de liquidez personalizados, con características clave que incluyen tarifas dinámicas, sistemas de reembolso y órdenes limitadas en cadena. Tras su lanzamiento inicial en BNB Chain en abril, el cambio a Base ha coincidido con el valor total bloqueado de la red. CAKE también está ganando en medio de una nueva campaña de incentivos de la red. “PancakeSwap se complace en lanzar una nueva campaña comercial con cinco tokens Binance Alpha en BNB Chain: Bedrock (BR), MilkyWay (MILK), League of Traders, NodeOps (NODE) y Moonveil (MÁS) ¡Debido a los comentarios de la comunidad, la campaña se ha extendido! Ahora tiene tiempo extra para participar y puede ganar una parte de ~ $ 250,000 en recompensas al intercambiar estos tokens en PancakeSwap hasta el 5 de agosto de 2025”, escribió el DEX en una publicación de blog. Los detalles muestran que el TVL ha subido a más de $ 4.29 mil millones, un aumento de más del 33% en lo que va del año. El interés en la implementación de la base ha hecho que el volumen de DEX de 24 horas para PancakeSwap aumente casi un 200% a más de 4417 millones. Según CoinMaketCap, la capitalización de mercado de CAKE ha aumentado a más de $ 2.3 mil millones. ¿Qué sigue para el precio de CAKE? Al momento de escribir, la ganancia del 13% del token nativo PancakeSwap en las últimas 24 horas lo coloca en la parte superior de la lista de ganadores en este período. El analista de criptomonedas CryptoBullfish compartió la siguiente opinión sobre CAKE y BNB: $CAKE is probably the most undervalued coin right now. $BNB is trading at all-time highs, while the main DEX token on BSC still has 15x potential just to reclaim its previous ATH. pic.twitter.com/pUckJ6mZS8 — Crypto฿ullfish (@cryptobullfish) July 27, 2025 El repunte del 19% de CAKE en la última semana también lo ubica entre los 10 primeros, detrás de Ethena, Flare, Cronos y Story. Mientras que BNB aprovechó la actividad de BNB Chain para alcanzar un nuevo máximo histórico por encima de los 850 dólares, PancakeSwap buscaba nuevas ganancias en torno a los 3.30 dólares. Si CAKE rompe este nivel de resistencia crítico, podría ser testigo de un impulso audaz hacia $ 5 y potencialmente $ 10. Por el contrario, el soporte se sitúa en torno a los 2 dólares.",

        "The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency in 2025 is unfolding rapidly. As institutional acceptance of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs surges, attention is now turning to a broader class of assets—specifically altcoins like XRP. With XRP’s legal clarity improving and regulatory frameworks slowly opening, 2025 may be the year XRP-based ETFs become a reality. XRP’s Legal Clearance: The Catalyst for Institutional AdoptionThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) v. Ripple lawsuit, which had been ongoing since late 2020, took a significant turn in mid-2023 when a federal judge declared that XRP does not qualify as a security in secondary market transactions. This decision provided long-awaited regulatory clarity. By 2025, further developments, including SEC silence on appeal and growing bipartisan pressure for crypto legislation, solidified XRP’s legal standing for ETF consideration.Having largely resolved the legal uncertainty, issuers such as Bitwise, VanEck, and 21Shares have filed for spot XRP ETFs. Industry analysts now estimate that approval odds for an XRP ETF are above 90% by Q4 2025, according to a report by Coinpedia and forecasts from Bloomberg ETF strategist James Seyffart.For more: Analyzing the Boom of Crypto ETFs in 2025From Demand-Side Mechanics, Who Would Buy XRP ETFs?XRP remains one of the most transacted assets globally, often ranking in the top 10 by 24-hour volume. It has carved a niche as a bridge currency for cross-border settlement. RippleNet has clients in over 70 countries. Yet, XRP’s integration into regulated portfolios has been constrained by legal ambiguity—until now.Should a spot XRP ETF be approved, it is expected to attract significant inflows from institutional allocators, managed portfolios, and thematic ETF wrappers. In Q2 2025 alone, over $22.7 billion in net new assets flowed into crypto ETFs, according to CoinShares. If XRP captures 5–10% of that pipeline post-launch, it could see early inflows of $1.1 to $2.2 billion.Ethereum spot ETFs launched in May 2025 and accumulated $1.3 billion in AUM within the first 60 days, per The Block Research.For more: The Impact of Ethereum ETFs on ETH PriceWhat Happens When ETFs Buy XRP?Unlike futures ETFs that derive exposure via derivatives, spot ETFs require custodians to buy and hold actual XRP. This means that ETF inflows represent real market demand, pulling liquidity from exchanges and tightening supply.XRP’s current circulating supply is approximately 54 billion tokens, with about 2 billion in daily liquidity across major centralized exchanges. If ETFs collectively accumulate just 1.5% of the supply (800 million XRP), this could materially reduce sell-side pressure.Much like what occurred with Bitcoin ETFs—where IBIT and FBTC absorbed over 300,000 BTC, creating what analysts describe as a “soft floor” under the price—XRP ETFs could anchor the asset in institutional-grade custody, thereby dampening volatility and reducing speculative churn.User Score9.9 Promotion-10% Trading FeesGet 10% Lifetime Cashback on Every TradeClaim Reward Now!Learn moreDerivatives Markets Price in Volatility and DirectionBeyond regulatory filings, the “smart money” in the derivatives market is placing unambiguous bets. According to leading crypto derivatives analytics firm CoinGlass, Futures Open Interest—the total value of all outstanding XRP futures contracts—has surged to a two-year high of $1.8 billion. Crucially, this rise in open interest has been accompanied by a rising XRP price, a classic indicator of new, bullish capital entering the market.Further evidence from CoinGlass shows the XRP Options Put/Call Ratio has fallen to 0.68, meaning traders are buying significantly more call options (bets on a price increase) than put options. Perhaps most tellingly, options data platform Laevitas reports that Implied Volatility (IV) for contracts expiring around the Q4 SEC decision deadlines has spiked to 95%, indicating that the market is bracing for a massive price move contingent on the news.Technical and Institutional Drivers Supporting XRP ETF GrowthRegulatory signals, including the pending resolution in the Ripple lawsuit and shifting SEC posture under new leadership, have bolstered confidence in future XRP ETF approvals. XRP prices have rallied as speculators priced in ETF potential and broader mainstream acceptance. Technical analysis shows XRP surpassing key resistance levels, drawing fresh institutional interest.Additionally, financial media reports highlight multiple filings by 21Shares, Bitwise, WisdomTree, and Canary Capital for spot or futures XRP ETFs—indicating robust institutional positioning ahead of potential approvals. These movements mirror earlier waves that preceded Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF launches.For more: Altcoin ETFs After Solana – XRP, ADA, AVAX Next in LineAre XRP ETFs Inevitable?In late June 2025, the SEC quietly allowed Bitwise’s 10 Crypto Index Fund (BITW), which includes XRP, to convert into an ETF before temporarily halting it for procedural review. Although XRP’s ETF eligibility is not yet live for trading, this approval effectively recognised it. Further, the SEC has shown increasing openness under new leadership and political pressure from Congress to modernize financial innovation frameworks.Source: JamesInternational regulators are also making moves. Canada’s OSC and Singapore’s MAS are reviewing multiple filings for altcoin ETFs that include XRP, Solana, and Avalanche. If the U.S. leads with XRP ETF approval in Q4 2025, global fund passporting rules may accelerate adoption abroad.

Regulatory momentum from SEC guidance and pending legal resolution crops new opportunities. Institutional filings by major investment firms, formal SEC approvals for index products including XRP, and bullish market signals all point toward an official launch later in 2025.If approved, XRP ETFs are expected to draw substantial capital, tighten circulating supply, and introduce price-stabilizing mechanisms into XRP markets. For investors, these ETFs would combine regulatory security, mainstream access, and thematic exposure—all structured within regulated frameworks similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum.Given the current environment, XRP ETF approval would not only shape the future of XRP’s own price and adoption but could also pave the way for broader altcoin ETF products. As with BTC and ETH, spots now appear set for a relative mainstream rise—not just digital speculation.The post Analyzing the Incoming Wave of XRP ETFs in 2025 appeared first on NFT Evening.",

        "The post Ray Dalio Backs Bitcoin as Institutional Demand Grows appeared on BitcoinEthereumNews.com.Key Notes Ray Dalio cites growing fiscal risks, including a projected $12 trillion in new US Treasury issuance, as a key reason to buy BTC. Dalio, while still preferring gold over Bitcoin, acknowledged BTC’s role as a hedge against fiat devaluation. Despite Bitcoin pulling back to $117K, institutional accumulation continues at every dip, as per on-chain data. Bitcoin institutional demand continues to remain despite the Bitcoin BTC $118 798 24h volatility: 0.0% Market cap: $2.36 T Vol. 24h: $40.61 B price pullback to $117K recently, with billionaires like Ray Dalio backing the asset. With the US National Debt soaring past $37 trillion, Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, has suggested allocating 15% of the portfolio to BTC and gold. Back in 2022, billionaire investor Ray Dalio recommended having 1-2% exposure to Bitcoin. However, citing the “debt loom loop” in the US economy, Dalio has shifted his stance, asking investors to have 15% exposure to BTC. This demonstrates growing confidence in the asset. Dalio also highlighted the falling value of the US Dollar this year, which brings attention to assets like BTC, which is up by 27%, so far in 2025. While speaking on the Master Investor Podcast on July 27, Dalio mentioned the US government’s projected $12 trillion in new Treasury issuance over the next 12 months, needed to finance the nation’s $36.7 trillion debt load. This Treasury issuance is likely to be beneficial for Bitcoin and crypto, which will see increased capital inflows. Dalio said: “If you were optimizing your portfolio for the best return-to-risk ratio, you would have about 15% of your money in gold or Bitcoin.” Ray Dalio’s comments come amid worsening fiscal signals, as the US Treasury on Monday revised its borrowing forecast upward.

Dalio said: Ray Dalio’s comments come amid worsening fiscal signals, as the US Treasury on Monday revised its borrowing forecast upward. In Q3, the Treasury borrowing is likely to hit $1 trillion, $453 billion more than previously projected, followed by $590 billion in Q4. While Dalio disclosed that he personally holds “some Bitcoin,” he described his updated recommendation as flexible. He said that it’s up to individual investors to decide the mix of Bitcoin and gold in their portfolios. Earlier this week, veteran investor Robert Kiyosaki also stressed having hard assets like gold, silver, along with Bitcoin, in one’s portfolio amid rising US debt concerns. The billionaire investor still prefers gold over Bitcoin. He shared some skepticism of BTC’s potential as a reserve currency, pointing to issues such as surveillance risks and the inherent transparency of blockchain transactions. “Governments can see who is doing what transactions on it,” he said. Bitcoin’s $110K–$117K price range is seeing increased accumulation, with buyers entering on market dips and previous holders continuing to purchase at higher levels. The pattern suggests a staircase-like progression in cost basis distribution. Institutional players like Metaplanet have also continued with their BTC purchases this week. BTC is currently flirting at $118K levels. With the concerns of Trump tariffs behind us, market analysts maintain a cautiously optimistic stand for BTC and crypto. next Disclaimer: Coinspeaker is committed to providing unbiased and transparent reporting.

Explore expert insights and institutional trends driving this surge. Stay informed with COINOTAG. BitMine’s $60,000 Ethereum Valuation: What It Means for ETH BitMine Immersion Technologies, the largest public ETH holder, recently unveiled a bold valuation of $60,000 for Ethereum. This figure, derived from consultations with unnamed research firms, implies an 18-fold increase from ETH’s current price near $3,900. The valuation was presented in BitMine’s monthly video series, The Chairman’s Message , emphasizing Ethereum’s substantial growth potential within the crypto market. Understanding the Implied Value and Market Context The $60,000 valuation is illustrative, reflecting Ethereum’s replacement value from a Wall Street perspective. Despite being hypothetical, it underscores investor confidence amid ETH’s recent rally. Ethereum’s price surged 57% in the past month, significantly outpacing Bitcoin’s 10% gains. This momentum is supported by data showing ETH surpassing $3,900 for the first time since December 2024, signaling a robust recovery phase. What Analysts Predict for Ethereum’s Price Trajectory Market analysts are increasingly bullish on Ethereum’s outlook. Recent commentary from crypto experts highlights a potential breakout above a long-term trendline, which could trigger substantial price gains. One analyst noted Ethereum’s “relative strength for a breakout” after years of consolidation, suggesting that momentum could drive prices significantly higher in the next market cycle. Institutional Interest and Accumulation Trends Ethereum’s growing institutional adoption is a critical factor behind its bullish forecast. Several firms are reportedly allocating millions to ETH as part of treasury diversification strategies. Additionally, accumulation ratios have risen since April 2025, indicating increased demand. This trend reflects heightened investor confidence and positions Ethereum as a prime asset for future growth. How Does Ethereum’s Market Position Affect Its Future? Ethereum’s market dominance is strengthening as Bitcoin’s share declines below 60%, signaling capital flow into altcoins. This shift, combined with Ethereum’s upcoming 10th anniversary, has intensified investor focus. Experts suggest that these factors, alongside macroeconomic indicators like M2 money supply growth, support a valuation well above current levels. Expert Insights on Ethereum’s Undervaluation Crypto strategist Ted Pillows emphasizes that Ethereum remains undervalued relative to monetary supply metrics, projecting a fair value exceeding $8,000. He describes ETH as “one of the best trades out here,” highlighting the asset’s strong fundamentals and growth potential. These expert perspectives reinforce the narrative of Ethereum’s promising future. I’m excited about the upcoming weeks. Things are looking very bullish right now. Bitcoin’s dominance is dropping below 60%, which shows money is flowing into other coins. ETH is going to break $4,000, boosted by strong demand from institutional investors.

Recent analysis points to targets between $10 and $15 based on Elliott Wave theory.XRP PriceThe price action shows XRP forming higher lows while breaking through key resistance levels. This pattern suggests the beginning of what analysts call Wave 3, typically the strongest phase of an Elliott Wave cycle.XRP recently broke resistance at $3.23 after months of consolidation. The move marks what crypto analyst XRPunkie identifies as the end of Wave IV and the start of a powerful Wave 3 leg.The current structure shows upward-sloping exponential and simple moving averages. These technical indicators reflect growing momentum favoring buyers over sellers.On July 28, XRP rose over 2.5% to close near $3.30. The recovery from early session lows came with increased trading volumes and late-session buying pressure.Trading data shows well-defined ascending channels with higher lows forming between $3.16 and $3.22. Despite facing resistance near $3.23, XRP’s ability to break and hold above $3.30 indicates sustained bullish strength.Volume spikes reached 81.78 million at 4 PM and 69.06 million at 5 PM. These levels exceeded the 24-hour average by wide margins, confirming accumulation activity.Fibonacci Targets Create RoadmapTechnical analysis using Fibonacci extension levels identifies multiple resistance points ahead. Short-term targets include $4.12, $5.31, and $6.16 based on standard Fibonacci ratios.Those fib levels above could be some little Take Profits area for the Wave 3? I believe it could over extend to reach $13. Which is my target of $10-$15. We shall see. $XRP pic.twitter.com/EFtiMnwKRl— XRPunkie (@Shawnmark7899) July 25, 2025More aggressive projections reach $7.55 and $9.45. The 3.618 extension around $13.59 represents a potential ceiling for extended bullish moves.These levels serve as profit-taking zones within the projected third wave. Traders can use these checkpoints to manage positions along XRP’s anticipated rally.The analyst emphasizes maintaining current market structure for these targets to materialize. Continued bullish momentum could push XRP toward or beyond these upper zones.Trader Sentiment Shifts BullishBinance data reveals a strong shift in trader positioning toward bullish bets. As of 1:00 PM UTC, 72.96% of top trader accounts held long positions while just over 27% maintained short positions.Source: BinanceThis creates a long/short account ratio of 2.70, levels not seen in recent weeks. The sentiment extends beyond large traders, with 71.6% of all accounts taking long positions.The global long/short ratio across all participants reached 2.52. While this doesn’t guarantee immediate price increases, such positioning typically precedes larger moves.Interestingly, traders maintain reasonable position sizes despite bullish sentiment. The long/short ratio by position dropped from 2.95 to 2.76, showing risk management awareness.This pattern suggests smart money positioning for upside while controlling risk exposure. Traders remember July’s volatility and avoid overextending positions.Source: TradingViewFor immediate confirmation, analysts say XRP needs to break and hold above $3.31 resistance. Success at this level could quickly shift targets toward $3.50-$3.66 range.Current market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic. XRP’s ongoing use cases in cross-border payments and DeFi integration support fundamental strength.The asset’s resilience aligns with speculation around the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit. While recent court updates haven’t provided major surprises, legal developments continue influencing investor behavior.XRP price currently trades at approximately $3.307, representing a 2.67% gain in the last 24 hours according to the XRP Liquid Index.The post XRP (XRP) Price: Elliott Wave Analysis Points to Massive Upside as Bulls Take Control appeared first on CoinCentral.",

        'Zug, Switzerland, July 29th, 2025, ChainwireIka, the pioneering blockchain infrastructure provider, has officially launched its mainnet, marking a significant milestone in blockchain interoperability. The launch introduces the first-ever zero-trust multiparty computation (MPC) network capable of native cross-chain asset control directly from smart contracts on the Sui blockchain.Ika’s protocol allows Sui-based smart contracts to securely and seamlessly manage native assets across many blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and modern L1s and L2s, without relying on bridges, token wrapping, or trusted third parties. This breakthrough eliminates common risks associated with cross-chain solutions, such as vulnerabilities inherent in bridging protocols or wrapped tokens, fundamentally transforming blockchain interoperability.At the heart of Ika’s innovation is the introduction of dWallets, a decentralized, programmable, and transferable signing mechanism. dWallets enable both the user and the Ika network to collaboratively sign transactions, while enforcing logic governed by smart contracts. This empowers developers and institutions to build and operate securely across various blockchains with native asset control.The technological core of Ika is its novel 2PC-MPC cryptography protocol, previously thought impractical for decentralized environments due to latency, scalability, and security constraints. Ika has overcome these hurdles, delivering sub-second latency and linear scalability, without compromising on decentralization, delivering a network that can be supported by hundreds of operators globally. Each operation includes cryptographic safeguards that require explicit user participation, supporting a zero-trust security framework.The network’s native token, IKA, plays a critical role by securing the infrastructure through a decentralized, permissionless proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.

        "Ray Dalio, the billionaire behind Bridgewater Associates, says people should think about putting 15% of their money into gold or Bitcoin. His call comes as America’s debt nears the $37 trillion mark. He argues that holding hard assets can help when paper money loses value. Related Reading: Countdown To August 15: What XRP Investors Need To Know “If you were optimizing your portfolio for the best return-to-risk ratio, you would have around 15% of your money in Bitcoin or gold,” Dalio said during the Master Investor podcast this week. Dalio admits he owns only a little Bitcoin and still leans toward gold. But he’s clear that splitting that 15% between the two is up to each investor. Optimizing For A Debt‐Strained Dollar According to Dalio, the US government will need to sell about $12 trillion more in treasuries over the next year to deal with its growing bill. He pointed out that recent Treasury data shows borrowing in the third quarter of 2025 could hit $1 trillion—$453 billion above earlier estimates—and another $590 billion in the fourth quarter. He warns that printing or selling more debt tends to weaken a currency. That’s why gold and Bitcoin, which aren’t tied to any central bank’s balance sheet, can act as buffers against plain old dollars. Balancing Gold And Bitcoin Dalio said gold remains his go‐to choice. It has centuries of track record against inflation and crisis. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is newer and can swing wildly in price. It’s trading around $118,862, roughly 4% below its July 14 all‐time high of $123,250. While its ups and downs can add spice to returns, they can also give some investors sleepless nights. Dalio suggests you pick a mix that feels right. If you hate big price moves, tilt toward gold. If you can stomach Bitcoin’s roller‐coaster, you might give it a bigger slice. Midway Through The Conversation On Risk He raised the idea back in January 2022 with 1% to 2% in Bitcoin. Now he’s tripling that bucket. That jump shows how fast the mood can shift when national debt climbs. Dalio noted that other Western nations like the United Kingdom face the same “debt doom loop” he sees in the US. He said their currencies may lag behind hard assets, making gold and Bitcoin effective diversifiers when government bills keep piling up. Related Reading: Memecoins, NFTs Get Called Out By Their Own Architect: ‘Zero Intrinsic Value’ Role Of Reserve Currencies Despite his nod to Bitcoin, Dalio said it won’t replace the dollar or euro for central banks. He argued that public blockchains lack privacy. Every transaction is visible, so governments could still watch and intervene. Gold, in contrast, can change hands in private after it leaves the vault. That gives it an edge when you want to keep your holdings off the radar. Featured image from Meta, chart from TradingView",

He argues that holding hard assets can help when paper money loses value. “If you were optimizing your portfolio for the best return-to-risk ratio, you would have around 15% of your money in Bitcoin or gold,” Dalio said during the Master Investor podcast this week. Dalio admits he owns only a little Bitcoin and still leans toward gold. But he’s clear that splitting that 15% between the two is up to each investor. According to Dalio , the US government will need to sell about $12 trillion more in treasuries over the next year to deal with its growing bill. He pointed out that recent Treasury data shows borrowing in the third quarter of 2025 could hit $1 trillion—$453 billion above earlier estimates—and another $590 billion in the fourth quarter. He warns that printing or selling more debt tends to weaken a currency. That’s why gold and Bitcoin, which aren’t tied to any central bank’s balance sheet, can act as buffers against plain old dollars. Dalio said gold remains his go‐to choice. It has centuries of track record against inflation and crisis. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is newer and can swing wildly in price. It’s trading around $118,862, roughly 4% below its July 14 all‐time high of $123,250. While its ups and downs can add spice to returns, they can also give some investors sleepless nights. Dalio suggests you pick a mix that feels right. If you hate big price moves, tilt toward gold. If you can stomach Bitcoin’s roller‐coaster, you might give it a bigger slice. He raised the idea back in January 2022 with 1% to 2% in Bitcoin. Now he’s tripling that bucket. That jump shows how fast the mood can shift when national debt climbs. Dalio noted that other Western nations like the United Kingdom face the same “debt doom loop” he sees in the US. He said their currencies may lag behind hard assets, making gold and Bitcoin effective diversifiers when government bills keep piling up. Despite his nod to Bitcoin, Dalio said it won’t replace the dollar or euro for central banks. He argued that public blockchains lack privacy. Every transaction is visible, so governments could still watch and intervene. Gold, in contrast, can change hands in private after it leaves the vault. That gives it an edge when you want to keep your holdings off the radar. Featured image from Meta, chart from TradingView",

        "2025 has been shaping up to be a landmark year for investors pursuing the best crypto presale. And with the market in a state of recovery and coins chasing growth once more, attention is once again turning to the presales where the standout coins so far have been Punisher Coin ($PUN), Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), and Token6900 ($T6900). Each brings something radically different to the table, but all are competing to become the best crypto presale of 2025.We’ll look into what is driving these presales and making them, and especially the Punisher Coin, such captivating assets to buy.🔥Miss Out On This One and You’ll Feel The Burn 🔥Punisher Coin Is The Meme Coin That’s Not Playing AroundIn contrast to the pump-and-dump meme coins of the past, Punisher Coin is rewriting the meme coin playbook. It’s eschewing the old principles of the meme cryptos to offer something that is based on utility, real staking rewards and a community-rooted ecosystem. Built on the Ethereum (ERC-20) blockchain, it has been reeling in investors during its presale.What sets Punisher Coin apart?Massive Presale Allotment: 80% of the total supply is allocated for presale. This makes it one of the most equitable launches in crypto history.Staking Power: 22% of the total supply is reserved for staking rewards, with a 20-week vesting period that encourages long-term holding and engagement.Gamified Utility: Through “Punisher Missions,” users earn $PUN and even USDT for completing meme contests, crypto puzzles, and live challenges.Deflationary Model: Weekly token burns and buyback-and-burn events keep the supply in check while driving value.Bitcoin Hyper: Supercharging Bitcoin with Layer 2 and SVMIf you’re more interested in infrastructure than memes, then Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a name you need to know.Billed as a new Bitcoin Layer 2 chain, $HYPER uses the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to unlock smart contracts, staking, and governance on Bitcoin’s otherwise limited base layer. This means $HYPER is bringing DeFi-like speed and functionality to Bitcoin for the first time.Key presale features:Massive staking rewards for early buyersSVM architecture, delivering high speed and low feesGovernance and utility baked into the tokenomics: Holders can stake, vote, and transact with $HYPEREarly access utility: Use your tokens right out of presale for ecosystem featuresBitcoin Hyper’s vision is simple but works very well and makes Bitcoin programmable and fast. With Ethereum and Solana dominating DeFi, $HYPER might be Bitcoin’s answer to staying relevant in a smart contract-driven world.Token6900 Is When Peak Meme Meets Peak FinanceOn the surface, Token6900 is the latest meme coin to ride the wave; but underneath is a structured, satire-soaked launch modeled after the S&P500.Here’s what makes $T6900 unique:$5M hard cap for the presale keeps the launch controlled and sustainableS&P500-inspired parody tokenomics reflect real-world finance through the lens of crypto absurditySelf-aware meme branding: this isn’t a utility token pretending to be serious; it leans into the chaosThe Best Crypto Presale of 2025?If you’re looking for long-term value, real community, and unique rewards, Punisher Coin has everything a modern investor could ask for, and more. It combines the viral power of meme coins with the structure and sustainability of a blue-chip project.That’s why Punisher Coin is shaping up to be the best crypto presale of 2025, and the one most likely to surprise the market.Join The Dark Side With Punisher Coin:Website – https://punishercoin.com/X – https://x.com/PunisherCoin_AITelegram – https://t.me/Pun_CoinThe post The Best Crypto Presale of 2025?

        "Press Releases are sponsored content and not a part of Finbold's editorial content. For a full disclaimer, please click here . Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you’re prepared to lose all the money you invest. Ika Launches Mainnet to Enable Native Cross-Chain Asset Control on Sui Blockchain Zug, Switzerland, July 29th, 2025, Chainwire Ika , the pioneering blockchain infrastructure provider, has officially launched its mainnet, marking a significant milestone in blockchain interoperability. The launch introduces the first-ever zero-trust multiparty computation (MPC) network capable of native cross-chain asset control directly from smart contracts on the Sui blockchain. Ika’s protocol allows Sui-based smart contracts to securely and seamlessly manage native assets across many blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and modern L1s and L2s, without relying on bridges, token wrapping, or trusted third parties. This breakthrough eliminates common risks associated with cross-chain solutions, such as vulnerabilities inherent in bridging protocols or wrapped tokens, fundamentally transforming blockchain interoperability. At the heart of Ika’s innovation is the introduction of dWallets, a decentralized, programmable, and transferable signing mechanism. dWallets enable both the user and the Ika network to collaboratively sign transactions, while enforcing logic governed by smart contracts. This empowers developers and institutions to build and operate securely across various blockchains with native asset control. The technological core of Ika is its novel 2PC-MPC cryptography protocol, previously thought impractical for decentralized environments due to latency, scalability, and security constraints. Ika has overcome these hurdles, delivering sub-second latency and linear scalability, without compromising on decentralization, delivering a network that can be supported by hundreds of operators globally. Each operation includes cryptographic safeguards that require explicit user participation, supporting a zero-trust security framework. The network’s native token, IKA, plays a critical role by securing the infrastructure through a decentralized, permissionless proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. IKA tokens are integral for transaction fees, spam prevention, rewarding reliable operators, and network governance. Several leading blockchain projects on Sui are already utilizing Ika’s mainnet, demonstrating the protocol’s versatility and robustness: Native is enhancing Bitcoin liquidity through native lending and DeFi services. Human Tech delivers “Wallet-as-a-Protocol” solutions, seamlessly managing cross-chain assets. Rhei Finance offers institutional-grade zero-trust multi-chain DeFi services. Aeon advances decentralized custody solutions optimized for AI-driven financial management. Nativerse pioneers Bitcoin-backed stablecoins without synthetic or wrapped intermediaries. Ekko integrates AI chatbots with decentralized security via MPC technology. Legacy Link facilitates secure digital asset inheritance through streamlined estate management. Full Sail introduces an advanced Automated Market Maker (AMM) leveraging Ika’s interoperability. “Today marks the start of a new era in blockchain interoperability,” said Ika Co-Founder Omer Sadika. “Our mainnet launch is not just a technological milestone, but a paradigm shift, bringing native Zero-Trust interoperability to Sui , and unlocking unprecedented possibilities for developers, institutions, and individual users alike.” With Ika now live, blockchain projects, financial institutions, and developers can deploy multi-chain applications on Sui, operate as network participants, or engage with the Ika network. For further information, users can visit https://ika.xyz or follow Ika on X . About Ika Ika is the fastest parallel MPC network, offering sub-second latency, unprecedented scale and decentralization, and zero-trust security. As the premier choice for interoperability, decentralized custody, and chain abstraction, Ika is set to revolutionize digital asset security and multi-chain DeFi.

        "Donald Trump mise sur les cryptomonnaies pour les prêts immobiliers Il y a quelques jours, la Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) a proposé que Fannie Mae et Freddie Mac, piliers du système hypothécaire américain, puissent intégrer les cryptomonnaies à leurs critères d’évaluation du risque. Autrement dit, les emprunteurs pourraient ne plus avoir à convertir leurs cryptomonnaies pour obtenir un prêt . Par ailleurs, l’administration Trump a confirmé son ambition de positionner la cryptomonnaie comme un actif à part : 💡 Retrouvez le guide des meilleures plateformes pour acheter des cryptomonnaies Les oppositions se montrent cependant critiques à ce stade.

Les retraites, bientôt alimentées par les cryptomonnaies ? Autre domaine où les cryptomonnaies pourraient révolutionner le quotidien des Américains : les retraites. En milieu de mois, on apprenait en effet que le président souhaitait intégrer les cryptos aux 401k , c’est-à-dire les plans d’épargne retraite les plus utilisés aux États-Unis . 👉 Dans l’actualité – Bitcoin : les marchés haussiers paraboliques et les krachs dévastateurs font-ils partie du passé ?

Un projet de décret permettrait ainsi d’investir dans la cryptomonnaie et les métaux précieux via les plans de retraite. Exemptions fiscales et stablecoins Parmi les autres mesures en projet pour le gouvernement Trump, on peut aussi citer des exemptions fiscales . Le changement permettra d’exempter de taxes les petites transactions en Bitcoin. Cela permettrait de favoriser leur utilisation pour les petits paiements, et donc l’usage des BTC en tant qu’espèces. Autre axe de développement : les stablecoins. La loi « GENIUS Act », adoptée récemment, encadre l’émission de stablecoins par des acteurs privés .

        "详细分析 在以太坊市场中,一项引人注目的机构行为显示,Konstantin Lomashuk(Twitter账号@Lomashuk)从去中心化借贷平台Aave借入8500万USDT,用于购买ETH。根据区块链分析公司Lookonchain的报告,这一交易突显出主要参与者如何利用DeFi协议进行大规模加密货币收购。他将8000万USDT转移给AmberGroup,后者将这些稳定币存入交易所,并从交易所提取了15814枚ETH(价值约5975万美元)。这一活动发生在2025年7月29日左右,可能预示着ETH的看涨情绪,特别是交易者关注链上指标以寻找价格催化剂。 借贷策略分析及对ETH交易者的市场影响 从交易角度来看,这次在Aave上的借贷行为代表了对ETH上涨潜力的战略押注。Aave作为领先的DeFi借贷协议,允许用户以USDT等稳定币作为抵押借贷,通常利率具有竞争力。Lomashuk借入如此巨额的8500万USDT,表明他对ETH短期表现的信心。交易者应注意AmberGroup的后续行动,将8000万USDT存入交易所并提取ETH,这指向直接转换策略。这可能涉及现货购买或杠杆头寸,影响ETH在Binance或OKX等平台上的流动性。在没有实时数据的情况下,从历史模式推断,此类机构流入往往先于波动性激增。例如,过去类似大额借贷与ETH价格上涨相关,特别是当交易量超过平均水平时。当前市场情绪受更广泛加密趋势影响,将此定位为ETH在3000至3500美元区间的潜在支撑位。考虑长仓的交易者,如果链上数据显示鲸鱼积累增加,可考虑入场点,同时监控Aave借贷利率以防过度杠杆风险。 机构资金流动及链上指标监测 深入链上指标,AmberGroup从交易所提取15814枚ETH是减少卖压的关键信号。此类交易所流出往往标志积累阶段,机构将资产移至冷存储或DeFi协议用于收益耕作。根据Lookonchain分析,这一交易链——从Aave借贷到ETH提取——总价值约5975万美元,通过多个钱包无缝执行。对于加密交易者,这强调了使用Etherscan等工具跟踪实时钱包动向的重要性。在交易机会方面,如果ETH保持在3200美元关键支撑位以上(最近几周频繁测试),这可能催化向4000美元的突破,特别是伴随积极宏观因素如潜在降息影响风险资产。然而,风险存在:Aave高额借贷若ETH跌破抵押阈值,可能导致清算,引发连锁抛售。成交量分析显示,ETH的24小时交易量最近徘徊在150-200亿美元,此类流入可能推高它,提供ETH/USDT或ETH/BTC对的剥头皮机会。 扩展到跨市场相关性,这一事件与股市动态相关,科技股重的纳斯达克指数往往镜像加密运动。通过DeFi流入ETH的机构资金可能反映对AI和区块链整合的乐观,推动相关代币。交易者应关注与半导体 sector股票的相关性,因为AI驱动的计算需求间接支持以太坊生态。总之,Lomashuk的举动示例了DeFi借贷如何重塑加密交易策略,为现货和衍生品市场提供可操作洞见。通过关注验证链上数据,交易者可在对冲波动性的同时定位潜在反弹。",

With over $17.5 million raised and 573 million+ tokens sold, this payment-focused token is becoming a top choice for those looking for crypto with real utility. How Remittix Is Quietly Outperforming Big-Name Projects: Remittix is being talked about as the next 100x crypto, especially by traders focused on early stage crypto investment, cross-chain DeFi projects, and crypto solving real world problems. Final Thoughts: The DeFi Leaders Are Changing Ethereum ETF hype is real, and it is bringing new attention to ETH-based projects. Ethena’s growth in TVL and user momentum puts it at the front of the DeFi revival. But Remittix is the one combining product rollout with early utility. As more investors move beyond memes and speculation, tokens like RTX and ENA are proving that real use cases matter.

      content:
        "Lido’s Founder, Konstantin Lomashuk, was loaned about 85M USDT by lending protocol Aave, which he used to buy ETH. Arkham’s data showed that Lomashuk first sent 80M USDT to the Amber Group, which deposited all the funds into an exchange.Lookonchain reports revealed that the Lido Founder later withdrew approximately 15.81K ETH, worth about $59.75M, from the exchange. According to Arkham’s live data, his portfolio currently holds about 69.619K AETHWSETH worth over $318M. It also has about $5M worth of ETH left and slightly over 2K DAI valued at $2.08K.The Arkham data also showed that Lomashuk’s overall portfolio had increased by at least $9.48M, with the value of AWSTETH holdings jumping from $315.84M to $325.32M in a week (from July 22 to July 29). The holdings remained at $69.8K, but the price of AWSTETH surged from ~$4.5K to ~$4.6K within the same period. However, the total value of the holding dropped by 3.46% in the past 24 hours to $324.65M.Lomashuk says Ethereum is the world’s ledgerMajor historical phases of ETH prices. Source: Cyber.Fund.The Lido boss recently claimed that the Ethereum protocol was the world’s ledger. He and Artem Kotelskiy, the Head of Crypto Research at Cyber Fund, published a report in May claiming that Ethereum was the foundational infrastructure for DeFi. The duo further pointed out that Ethereum had over 25 million global users and processed more than 40% (~$0.5T) of weekly stablecoin volumes. They added that Visa and Stripe have exponentially adopted Ethereum as the base layer.The two industry KOLs said they had been building and investing on top of Ethereum for over a decade because they believed in the “vision of permissionless, horizontal coordination.” They also revealed that they had substantially increased their ETH holdings by 10x over time. Lomashuk and Kotelskiy added that Ethereum was their “highest conviction bet.” Lido’s Lomashuk previously teased that he would be building the second generation of Ethereum before he was quickly made to swallow his words following online backlash from industry players. He jokingly stated that he was just messing around with random tweets, saying that “a tweet was just a tweet...” “No actual second foundation has been created yet...If a second foundation ever does form, it must have a clear purpose that complements the enormous work of current contributors.”–Konstantin Lomashuk, Lido FounderHowever, the Lomashuk and Koteskiy report asserted that Ethereum’s most important upgrades were EIP-1559, which redesigned the fee mechanism in the Summer of 2021, and “The Merge,” which transitioned the protocol to Proof-of-Stake in the Fall of 2022. ETH is dubbed “ultrasound money” According to the Lomashuk and Kotelskiy report, ETH was dubbed “ultrasound money,” referencing Bitcoin’s sound money narrative. Ethereum’s upgrade from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake made the protocol 8,000x more energy efficient, as the issuance required to reward nodes securing the ecosystem each year dropped from more than 4% to below 1%. Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s co-founder, outlined plans for the Ethereum Foundation’s major restructuring in January of this year. He pointed out that the reorganization would address inefficiencies and streamline decision-making. However, his remarks sparked criticism as some argued that the restructuring undermined the network’s decentralization ethos.Lomashuk recently claimed that Ethereum was the “ultimate world computer,” saying that Ethereans could help achieve the network’s growth, transformation, and success. He appreciated the support from all Ethereum ecosystem users, adding that more organizations needed to contribute to the network. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

        "The latest Bitcoin Price Prediction news is making waves as BTC continues to march towards the $120,000 mark. Bitcoin’s steady upward trajectory has fueled renewed confidence in crypto markets, with institutional investment and treasury purchases now fueling the renewed interest.While all eyes are on BTC, early schemes like Remittix (RTX) are gradually gaining traction from altcoin traders looking for the next 100x cryptocurrency — especially those with practical applications to real-world finances.Bitcoins’ momentum revives altcoin frenzyBitcoin is currently trading at $118,888.16 after it closed the previous 24 hours higher by 0.69%. Its market cap is over $2.36 trillion and its daily trade volume increased to more than $61.39 billion in a 33.22% jump in activity.This movement has sparked broader interest in top crypto to invest in now, particularly from crypto treasuries seeking exposure to investments other than BTC and ETH. With liquidity returning to the market, there is a sharp move toward low gas fee crypto projects, DeFi staking platforms, and cross-chain DeFi projects with practical use cases.The shift is not theoretical. Investors are increasingly interested in crypto resolving real-world challenges, and that is where Remittix is stepping in to take the gap.Remittix Wallet Beta Launch Announced for Q3 2025Remittix (RTX) is among the best crypto projects of 2025 that is poised to shake up the $19T global payments industry with a streamlined, crypto-powered solution. The project just announced that its beta wallet will launch in Q3 2025, backed by Solana, Ethereum, and an array of fiat integrations.The Remittix Wallet will enable users to send crypto like BTC, ETH, and XRP into bank accounts of over 30 countries — without the need for centralized exchanges and cutting fees. This is a clear direction towards getting crypto with real utility to the masses.Now priced at $0.0876 per RTX, the project has already exceeded $17.5 million in its presale, having sold more than 573 million tokens. With the project closing in on its $18M soft cap, a 50% token bonus remains active, and the team has also established a $250,000 Remittix Giveaway to encourage early adoption.Why Remittix Is Building MomentumReal-World Utility: Fiat-to-crypto transfers, no middlemenGlobal Reach: Bank payouts in 30+ countriesBeta Wallet Launch: Q3 2025Community Support: $17.5 million + raised, gathering pace50% Bonus: Being active throughout current presale phaseBitcoin Price Prediction Drives Interest in Real Use CasesWhen BTC rises, the entire market is seeking underrated crypto projects having working products. Bitcoin Price Prediction searches naturally result in activity for early-stage crypto investments, especially those solving issues like remittances, conversion lag times, and layer 2 Ethereum solutions.Remittix’s emphasis on usability in the real world — fast, borderless, and adoptive — positions it among the leading DeFi opportunities for 2025. As opposed to much of the altcoin universe still back in whitepaper design, RTX has the benefit of working infrastructure, a mobile-first wallet, and a clear strategy for scaling international payments.As the beta wallet launches, just weeks off, Remittix is now an integral part of this new ecosystem in many people’s eyes.Discover the future of PayFi with Remittix by checking out their project here:Website: https://remittix.io/Socials: https://linktr.ee/remittix$250,000 Giveaway: https://gleam.io/competitions/nz84L-250000-remittix-giveawayThe post Bitcoin Price Prediction: BTC Surges Near $120K – Crypto Treasuries Fuel Altcoin Season, and Remittix Is Leading appeared first on CoinCentral.",

        "As the crypto market begins to separate hype-driven tokens from infrastructure-heavy protocols, analysts are turning their attention toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM)—a next-generation DeFi project quietly preparing to reshape on-chain lending. While top altcoins like Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) continue to face stagnation from regulatory pressure and scalability concerns, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction for building a highly flexible, dual-model lending ecosystem that supports both risk-on and conservative digital assets.Mutuum Finance (MUTM)Unlike legacy DeFi protocols that lock users into a single borrowing structure, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building to introduce two concurrent lending models: peer-to-peer (P2P) for speculative assets like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE, and peer-to-contract (P2C) for stablecoins and top-tier tokens like ETH and USDC. This two-pronged system is designed to attract a wider spectrum of users—from degen yield chasers to institutional players seeking risk-managed borrowing. Loans issued through both models will require overcollateralization, a safeguard powered by the platform’s Stability Factor mechanism. This metric continuously monitors loan-to-value ratios, ensuring the protocol remains solvent even during volatile market swings.This type of design not only limits default risk but positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a more reliable long-term play—one that fits the checklist of both individual investors and large funds looking for compliant, smart contract-enforced lending solutions. And with institutional capital seeking safer ways to enter the DeFi space, MUTM’s architecture stands out as a high-conviction, low-friction opportunity.Presale Gains Fuel FOMO as Yield Mechanics Power Long-Term GrowthCurrently in Phase 6 of its presale at a price of $0.035, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already drawing serious attention. With over $13.7 million raised and more than 14,500 holders onboarded, only 5% of the token supply of the current phase has been distributed so far. The next presale phase will trigger a 15% price increase—making the current window a limited-time entry point for those seeking early-stage, undervalued DeFi gems.The protocol has passed a rigorous audit by CertiK, the industry’s leading blockchain security firm, scoring 95.00 in Token Scan and 78.00 in Skynet—two of the highest confidence metrics for any upcoming DeFi token. The audit, initiated in February and updated in May 2025, included deep static analysis and manual code reviews. For added transparency and credibility, a $50,000 bug bounty remains live, encouraging ethical developers to report any system vulnerabilities before the mainnet launch.MUTM RewardsThe Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ecosystem revolves around mtTokens—interest-bearing tokens minted when users deposit assets into lending pools. These tokens accrue yield automatically, increasing in value over time. For users seeking to enhance returns, staking mtTokens in dedicated smart contracts unlocks an additional revenue stream: passive MUTM rewards generated from the platform’s buyback system. As a portion of protocol revenue will be regularly used to repurchase MUTM from the market, supply pressure is expected to decline over time—pushing the floor price upward for stakers and holders alike.Take the case of one early investor who reallocated $5,000 from Ethereum (ETH) into Phase 2 of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale at just $0.015 per token. That move secured roughly 333,333 MUTM tokens. At today’s price of $0.035 in Phase 6, that initial allocation is already worth $11,667—delivering an impressive 133% return even before the token hits exchanges. But this story doesn’t end there. With the confirmed listing price set at $0.06, that same position is on track to grow to a value of $20,000—representing a full 300%+ return in under a year.Utility Expansion and Beta Launch Set the Stage for Explosive GrowthMutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just a lending hub—it’s building a fully integrated ecosystem that will include a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin, dynamically minted during loan issuance and burned upon repayment. This design will ensure strict control over supply while maintaining a consistent $1 peg, addressing the shortcomings of failed algorithmic stablecoins in the market. Additionally, the platform is preparing for a beta launch at the time of listing, a major catalyst that will activate real-time borrowing, staking, and liquidation features across its smart contract infrastructure.With plans to launch on a Layer-2 network, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is expected to offer lower gas fees, faster confirmations, and better scalability than most first-gen DeFi platforms. As total value locked (TVL) grows and the stablecoin gains traction, demand for MUTM tokens is projected to accelerate dramatically—fueled by real use cases rather than empty speculation.The DeFi sector is primed for a new market leader—one that blends financial utility with tokenholder upside. By creating an open, secure, and flexible lending protocol that appeals to both institutions and retail users, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly rising to challenge established names like Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP). And with its presale still open at just $0.035, this may be the last chance to catch a 200x opportunity before it takes off.For more information about Mutuum Finance (MUTM) visit the links below:Website: https://www.mutuum.comLinktree: https://linktr.ee/mutuumfinanceDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

This feature lets US businesses accept payments in over 100 cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT.This is huge news as it simplifies cross-border transactions and cuts transaction fees by up to 90% compared to traditional credit card transactions.Imagine a shopper in Guatemala buying a special gift from a merchant in Oklahoma City. Using PayPal’s open platform, the business can accept crypto for payments, increase their profit margins, pay lower transaction fees, get near instant access to proceeds, and grow funds stored as PYUSD at 4%5 when held on PayPal.—Alex Chriss, PayPal PRWith more businesses integrating crypto payments, the door is wide open for innovation in the financial world. This sets the stage for early-stage projects like Best Wallet Token ($BEST), the native token of the top non-custodial wallet, Best Wallet.With over $14M raised in its presale, $BEST offers solid perks like lower trading fees, staking rewards, and governance rights within its multi-chain Web3 ecosystem.As mainstream platforms like PayPal push crypto into the spotlight, projects like $BEST are next in line to benefit from the growing demand for secure DeFi solutions.Find out how to buy Best Wallet Token.MARA to Invest ~$1B in Bitcoin and ‘Never Sell’ – Massive Hype for Bitcoin Hyper PresaleJuly 29, 2025 • 10:00 UTCUS-based Bitcoin miner MARA is close to buying $950M Bitcoin after a private offering. The company is clearly copying Strategy’s entire guidebook to Bitcoin HODLing and said it would ‘never sell’ $BTC.This HODLing strategy is a result of the huge institutional adoption we’ve seen recently:Strategy holds 607,770 $BTC (~$72B)MARA Holdings has 50K $BTC (~$5.9B)XXI has 37,230 $BTC (~4.4B)Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company has 30,021 $BTC ($3.5B)Riot Platforms has 19,225 $BTCIn total, the top 5 institutional Bitcoin holders have $88B between them, and the flywheel effect is becoming visible. Here’s Strategy’s all-time stock performance:Clearly, the Bitcoin HODLing strategy is working. MARA’s decision is only reasonable given the current climate.And one presale project that’s positioned to benefit from the Bitcoin adoption is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), an innovative Layer-2 ecosystem. It aims to bring smart contracts, dApps, and DeFi expansion to the Bitcoin chain.Its presale has raised over $5.6M as investors are frenzying to get in early.

        "In the cryptocurrency market, an investor can easily save himself from the destructive impacts of a crash by following appropriate risk management.",
      content:
        "Of the many unwanted events in life, the most unpleasant one can be a crash in the market in which you have invested your hard-earned money. History is replete with major and minor crashes in stock markets. Although the cryptocurrency market is too young to feature as many crashes as traditional markets, lack of any major precedence does not guarantee a secure future. The year 2022 is remembered as an infamous year in this respect due to the Terra Luna crash and FTX crash. Regardless of the track record a crypto investor must always remain prepared for a crash.Infamous Crypto CrashesTerra Luna CrashWiping out a staggering $80B, the Terra Luna crash was an unforeseen event as it befell an asset that was ranking among the top ten cryptocurrencies at that moment. It serves as a stark reminder of how quickly fortunes can reverse. The collapse was driven by a combination of flawed tokenomics, excessive dependence on unsustainably high yields, particularly through the Anchor protocol, and a disastrous loss of investor confidence.Whoever bought a $UST was issued $1 worth of $Luna. When investors lost confidence due to the reasons mentioned above, a selling spree set off, causing the minting of an incredibly large number of $Luna. The price of the token plummeted from $120 to almost $0 in a matter of days. Moreover, the incident took place when the market was already turning bearish. This crash accelerated the bearish trend.Crypto Exchange CrashesMt. Gox was the largest cryptocurrency exchange in 2014, when it handled 70% of $BTC transactions. 850,000 $BTC were stolen from the exchange, causing a loss of $450 Million as per the price of that time. It caused a plunge in the price of Bitcoin from $1150 to below $400.$8 Billion of customers’ funds were wiped out when an alleged fraud caused the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX. SBF was later convicted of fraud when the misappropriation of the funds was legally proved.These were only major crashes. Various minor crashes also occurred before, between and after the mentioned incidents. But these crashes are nothing as compared to the 1929 and 1987 American Stock Exchange Crashes that spread unprecedented panic among investors. Yet, the crypto market reflects the movements of SPX-500 and Nasdaq. Any crash in the indices can bring a similar disaster in the crypto market as well.Triggers of a CrashSince the crypto market is too young to offer a broad general view of the causes of a crash, it seems pertinent to look at stock market crashes. The lessons extracted from the overview can be applied to the cryptocurrency market.1929 Stock Market CrashThe 1929 stock market crash, known as Black Tuesday (October 29, 1929), was triggered by multiple factors: speculation, economic weaknesses, and panic. Throughout the 1920s, U.S. stock prices rose by dint of increased margin buying, where investors borrowed money to purchase stocks, driving prices far beyond their real value. This speculative bubble left the market extremely vulnerable.By mid-1929, economic cracks began to appear as falling consumer demand, decreasing industrial production, and overproduction in key sectors. When stock prices started slipping in September 1929, investors’ confidence stumbled. A series of massive sell-offs ensued, as investors rushed to liquidate positions to avoid debt from margin calls.The panic culminated on October 24 (Black Thursday) and October 29 (Black Tuesday), when billions of dollars in market value evaporated in a single day. The crash didn’t cause the Great Depression by itself but acted as a catalyst for the economic collapse that followed.Black Mondy 1987Black Monday (October 19, 1987) was triggered by a combination of market vulnerabilities and panic-driven sell-offs. The U.S. stock market had surged by over 40% in 1987, creating overvalued conditions. Rising interest rates and inflation fears began eroding investor confidence.An important factor was the introduction of computerized trading after 1980. New things have always raised reservations in many fields of life. It also happened among investors and their doubts caused them to lose confidence. They started selling their shares and triggered a crash.Global market interconnections worsened the panic, as crashes in Asian and European markets spilled into U.S. trading. Rumors, lack of liquidity, and investor fear further accelerated the sell-off.By the end of Black Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 22.6% in a single day, the largest one-day percentage drop in its history, triggering reforms in market safeguards and trading halts. One of the reforms was the incorporation of circuit breaker. It is a mechanism to halt trading once the market falls to certain levels.On the whole, there are two driving forces behind a crash – be it in the stock markets or the crypto markets. When a market keeps rising, it usually enters an overbought zone and gets overvalued. If not a crash, a correction becomes imminent in such a situation. The other thing is the investors’ confidence. This can be shaken by anything, sometimes even by unrelated things.Key Takeaways for a Crypto InvestorOf the millions of cryptocurrencies being traded in the market, hardly is there any one reliable enough to be compared with Bitcoin. Since 2009, the time of its inception, $BTC has crashed many times, but recovered with more vigor and momentum, posting new ATH every cycle. On the other hand, other coins and tokens rose like a bubble but vanished in thin air, never to be seen again. Very few have survived more than a cycle.As an investor, what you can do is to do proper risk management and sensible diversification. Within a trade, do not forget to place stop-loss and take-profit orders as the crypto market is open 24/7 and you may not be available to react when the market undergoes wild swings.ConclusionWhen the market goes up, it causes FOMO and more people enter the market. The market gets overbought, and correction becomes necessary. Sometimes, whales’ confidence is shaken, and huge drainage of money causes major crashes. In the crypto market, an investor can save himself from the impacts of a crash by following appropriate risk management.",

L’année 2025 affiche déjà 29,5 milliards de dollars d’entrées, pulvérisant les records précédents. Les chiffres sont là : les cryptomonnaies, même secouées, fascinent toujours les marchés institutionnels. Ether vole la vedette : entre afflux records et espoirs réglementaires Avec 1,59 milliard de dollars de nouveaux fonds injectés en une semaine, les ETP Ether signent leur deuxième plus gros afflux hebdomadaire de tous les temps. Un chiffre qui fait tourner les têtes, d’autant plus qu’il arrive dans un contexte de légère baisse du cours de l’ETH. Pour James Butterfill, responsable de la recherche chez CoinShares, ce mouvement massif n’est pas un feu de paille, mais bien une manœuvre liée à l’anticipation des ETF basés sur l’Ether. Et Ether n’est pas seul dans cette envolée. Solana et XRP, avec respectivement 311,5 et 189,6 millions de dollars d’entrées, s’inscrivent dans cette stratégie de pré-positionnement. Les investisseurs parient clairement sur la prochaine vague de régulation américaine, qui pourrait ouvrir les vannes des ETF sur d’autres cryptos majeures. À l’opposé, Litecoin et Bitcoin Cash essuient de modestes retraits. Ces sorties, bien que limitées, suggèrent une sélectivité accrue des investisseurs. Le capital cherche la liquidité, mais aussi la crédibilité. Et dans cette quête, l’Ether, appuyé par son écosystème robuste et ses perspectives d’ETF, prend une longueur d’avance. Une dynamique qui ralentit, mais qui s’installe Malgré cette 15e semaine d’afflux, la mécanique commence à marquer le pas. Les 1,9 milliard de dollars de cette semaine représentent une baisse de 57 % par rapport aux 4,4 milliards enregistrés précédemment. Un ralentissement ? Plutôt une respiration, à en croire les données. Les géants comme BlackRock, avec ses iShares crypto ETF, ont mené les entrées (1,56 milliard), bien que ce chiffre soit en chute libre par rapport à la semaine d’avant. Du côté des autres acteurs, Fidelity continue ses sorties (123 millions), tandis qu’ARK Invest tempère sa fuite de capitaux. Seul 21Shares, basé en Europe, maintient le cap avec une croissance modeste mais stable. Quant à Grayscale, les chiffres sont paradoxaux : 356 millions de dollars d’entrées récentes, mais une année encore marquée par 1,3 milliard de sorties cumulées. Ce contraste illustre les turbulences que traverse l’institutionnel dans sa quête d’exposition crypto. BlackRock, en revanche, domine sans partage avec 25,8 milliards de dollars d’entrées en 2025, captant à lui seul 87,5 % des flux totaux vers les ETP crypto . Une position hégémonique qui laisse peu de doute : la finance traditionnelle a bien pris ses quartiers dans l’univers des actifs numériques.",

        "The Market Vector indexes had a good July recovery. Most of the indexes climbed back to positive levels after leading to negative results in Q2. Although gains were experienced in all areas, the traders concentrated on large, liquid assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum.Institutional Inflows Drive Blue Chip GainsMost gains during July were a result of institutional demand, with BTC and ETH attracting the most inflow. Better performance was experienced in blue-chip assets, with some indexes almost touching or equaling all-time highs. Bitcoin rose to more than 123,000, which boosted associated indexes. The top 10 digital asset index gained a lot, with Ethereum posting high performance and reaching over 40,000 points. Corporate treasury announcements helped to sustain this growth even before the company had made any acquisitions.The Gold Crypto Leader Index rose to its highest point in five years, 683 points. The index, which is comprised of more than 50 percent gold, was an indicator of the growing popularity of investments that were perceived to prevent a rise in inflation. It has since added more than 100 percent in two years. Solana and BNB also came into the spotlight, continuing the good performance in high-cap cryptocurrencies.Retail Activity Lags Behind Institutional TrendsThough institutional players participated more, retail crypto activity was not high. Although the memecoin index is frequently viewed as a proxy of retail sentiment, it shot up to over 73 points in July against the industry base of 50. Nonetheless, it is yet to reach its high point of 165, reached in November 2024. Meme tokens were more like the favorites of crypto insiders and whales and were mostly muted.Retail and institutional assets continued to have a gap in performance. The media and entertainment crypto projects, as well as Web3, displayed insignificant changes in value. The infrastructure app index traded laterally, indicating that retail was quiet even as the rest of the market recovered.DeFi and Smart Contracts Show Gradual RecoveryThe growth of the DeFi index was not significant. The index grew by approximately 11 points or by more than 31 points in July, its best performance since February. Nevertheless, even after the recovery, DeFi assets gained at slower rates than assets related to BTC or ETH.Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) recorded a larger jump in innovative contract platforms. The index of smart contracts rose to over 169 points as compared to 126. This tendency evoked the emergence of new interest in layer-one blockchain platforms, and ETH and SOL have been leading these rankings.As much as the rebound is widespread, the best impetus has been of high note in the bigger liquid crypto assets. The flow of institutions is determining the trend of the market right now, whereas retail activity remains well behind.The post Market Vector Indexes Rise in July as Traders Focus on Most Liquid Assets first appeared on Coinfea.",

It has a capped supply of 20 billion HEXY tokens broken down like this: The token reached $0.0038 in value during presale. This price jump shows strong confidence from the market. Investor interest surged further with news about its upcoming Binance launchpad listing and plans for a global pet marketplace. Presales in Q3 highlighted important investment trends. Projects offering multi-chain compatibility practical utilities, and clear tokenomics delivered the biggest profits. Early backers grabbed tokens at lower prices, while deflationary systems and staking rewards pushed many to hold for the long term. Frequent updates and detailed plans played a big role in keeping investors confident. Teams that provided weekly updates reported higher retention by as much as 30%. Crypto presales in 2025 have gained attention as better investment opportunities than established altcoins. One example is Hexydog ($HEXY), which has managed to raise over $530K so far and is priced at $0.0038 right now. Plans to list on the Binance launchpad and develop a global pet marketplace suggest it could see a lot of growth. Many investors understand that presales come with specific perks. They give buyers a chance to get tokens at much cheaper rates before they go public. Hexydog promotes long-term holding through deflationary features and staking rewards. It also dedicates 5% to charity for animal welfare showing a focus on giving back. As Bitcoin hits $118,000 and crypto ETFs see rising institutional investments, presale tokens hold promise as the next big area to explore. Hexydog ($HEXY) emerges as a top presale pick for 2025. It offers a mix of multi-chain features, uses that apply to real life, and a clear development process.

        "Coinbase Global Inc. COIN CEO Brian Armstrong said other G20 nations are now examining Bitcoin BTC/USD reserves following President Donald Trump ‘s establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve through executive order. What Happened : “Now that the U.S. is doing this I think like the rest of the G20 countries and central banks are all starting to look at this. It just kind of instantly legitimized it,” Armstrong said Monday on the Shawn Ryan Show. The CEO noted that Trump’s move represents a dramatic shift from government skepticism just five years ago. Trump signed an executive order in March creating the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, funded entirely through existing government Bitcoin holdings obtained via criminal and civil asset forfeiture proceedings. White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks confirmed the reserve contains approximately 200,000 Bitcoin worth roughly $17 billion, requiring no taxpayer funding. The reserve operates similarly to existing U.S. strategic stockpiles of gold, oil, palladium and rare minerals. Armstrong emphasized this historical context, calling it “a huge moment” that legitimizes Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Trump has positioned himself as “the first crypto president,” declaring America must lead in financial technology to maintain global power. The executive order also established a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile for other cryptocurrencies obtained through government proceedings. See Also: Bitcoin Drops As Michael Saylor’s Strategy Halts Accumulation Streak; Ethereum, Dogecoin Also Dip: Analyst Expects ‘Violent’ Week Ahead Why It Matters : The G20 comprises 19 countries plus the European Union and the African Union, representing the world’s major economies, including China, Japan, Germany, and the UK. Armstrong’s comments suggest broader institutional adoption may follow US leadership. Speculate on price movements, claim up to $200 in bonuses, and start with risk-free paper trading with crypto futures on Plus500. Corporate Bitcoin adoption continues to expand. MicroStrategy Inc. MSTR leads with 607,770 Bitcoin, while Tesla Inc. TSLA holds 11,509 Bitcoin according to Bitcoin Treasuries data. Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. DJT ranks sixth with 18,430 Bitcoin. Bitcoin traded around $118,895 as of Tuesday morning, up 0.03% as institutional accumulation patterns shift and markets await Federal Reserve policy decisions this week .

Big Launch, Bigger Rewards: Coingarage Drops GARA Presale + 400K Token Airdrop Coingarage, a fully regulated centralized crypto exchange in the European Union, has officially launched the presale of its native utility token, GARA, along with a 400,000 GARA airdrop. These key events represent a significant milestone in Coingarage’s mission to deliver a user-first, high-performance crypto trading platform. A Next-Generation Crypto Ecosystem Coingarage is developing a secure, easy-to-use crypto exchange tailored to beginners and seasoned traders. With regulation in place, the platform combines powerful features like AI trading tools, staking, and real-world payment solutions. At the core of the Coingarage platform is GARA, a utility token that powers key functionalities across the ecosystem. From trading discounts to governance, GARA was built to provide its holders with long-term value and daily utility. GARA Token Utility: Why It Matters The GARA token is more than a tradable asset; it’s a utility token designed to benefit active users: Reduced trading fees; Daily staking rewards of up to 31% APY; Deflationary tokenomics, including a monthly burn of 20% of GARA collected from platform fees, reduced the total supply from 900M to 200 M. Built on the Polygon blockchain, GARA ensures fast transactions, low gas fees, and sustainability through Proof of Stake (PoS). Presale & Airdrop: How to Get Involved The GARA token presale is now live on the official Coingarage website . Early supporters can buy GARA at a special pre-launch price. Buyers can choose from multiple presale packages, each offering bonus tokens, staking perks, and tiered pricing. The earlier you join, the better the rewards. To boost community engagement, Coingarage has also launched a Referral Program. Participants can earn 10% in USDT using their unique referral link for every successful GARA purchase. It’s a simple way to support the project while earning passive income. At the same time, Coingarage is running a 400,000 GARA airdrop to welcome new users and introduce them to the token’s utility. Hosted on the Zealy platform, the airdrop includes easy, interactive tasks designed to help users explore the Coingarage ecosystem and earn free GARA. Why Coingarage Stands Out Coingarage is a fully regulated EU exchange that combines strong regulatory backing with innovation. Its long-term vision includes launching AI-driven trading tools, offering payment solutions, and building an ecosystem where the GARA token is central to utility, rewards, and governance. This launch represents the beginning of a token and the growth of a new digital finance hub that prioritizes transparency, security, and community. Join the GARA Presale At the heart of the Coingarage ecosystem is GARA, the platform’s native utility token. Unlike speculative assets, GARA is designed for direct use within the exchange, powering lower trading fees, daily staking rewards of up to 31% APY, and unlocking key features across the platform. It also operates on a deflationary model, with 20% of GARA collected from platform fees burned monthly, gradually reducing the supply from 900 million to 200 million tokens. The GARA token presale is currently live. It offers early supporters access at $0.18, with a planned listing price of $0.36. The presale has already raised over $1.39 million of its $2.7 million goal, reflecting strong community interest and investor confidence. The multi-tiered structure rewards early participants with token bonuses, staking perks, and early access to platform tools. The official platform, Coingarage.io , clearly breaks down presale tiers, benefits, and how new users can participate with just a few clicks. Where to Find Out More? Join the presale , and airdrop , and connect with the Coingarage community through X (Twitter), Telegram, and Discord .",
